A marriage of that vintage freshness with the synthetic ambroxan, not entirely different from the marriage of aquatic to ambroxan in Dylan Blue. Same feel.  My wife liked it quite a bit, said it was, \"really nice, actually.\"  Yay.  Projection was low to moderate, longevity average.  ",

			"content": "Dirty pretty vetiver\n\r\nVetiver Elemi was a pleasant surprize. On paper, it smells like a luminous, citrusy-clean vetiver. However, the second I sprayed VE to my skin, an unexpected dirty cumin note burst through that bright opening. It's briefly reminiscent of body odour but then shifts into L'Artisan P Timbuktu territory.\n\r\nAs the scent dries down, the cumin recedes into the background, blending into the vetiver which develops a grassy, earthy and slightly smoky character. Prettier, faint and abstract florals and woods also soften up the scent. Lasts roughly four hours before drying down to a cleaner, woodsy skin scent.\n\r\nGentle enough for the office without being boring, very affordably priced, and manufactured without animal products, parabens and the like. Recommended to vetiver fans unless you don\u2019t do well with cumin.",

			"content": "Contrary to Eau d'Hadrien, I can barely smell any lime or lemon in Bois d'Hadrien, only a vague suggestion of a fresh fruity opening. And in a sense true to its name, Bois d'Hadrien indeed feels quite woody. However, these woody notes don't really have any charming characteristics of specific wood, either, but more like an abstract fruity woody note with certain similarities to Cashmeran. And it even turns a bit aridly smoky in the dry down, somewhat similar to the unpleasant effect of certain woody amber aromachemicals quite common these days.\n\r\nProbably thanks to these potent molecules, the projection of Bois d'Hadrien is rather heavy, and it can cling on skin for at least 10 hours. But in return, I find Bois d'Hadrien lacks urgently the subtle, poetic beauty of previous creations from the house of Goutal. As a result, I would not particularly recommend this fragrance, especially if you happen to be fan of Goutal's offerings before 2012 which feel completely different in style with Bois d'Hadrien.\n\r\nAs a side note, the spray mechanism of the new packaging is much better than the older Goutal sprayer! It gives out a very uniform spray and is much easier to press. ",

			"content": "Fruity, lemony, with the slightly anisic shading (basil?) also found in Eau Hadrien. \n\r\nThe perfume somewhat recalls YSL's Champagne, later renamed Yvresse after the champagne firms threw a wobbly. But more particularly it reminds me of a mens fragrance of the 1960's and 70's called West. Remember that one, by Faberge? All done up in cowboy packaging, a great fragrance, but it bit the dust, unlike its partner Brut which is still going. \n\r\nIvy is given as the heart note, however there is no natural extract of ivy that I know of, and the fragrance is not green in any sense, so this is doubtless just a flight of fancy. I wonder what the real heart notes are, the perfumers who worked on it will know, but they are not saying.\n\r\nDrydown results in a spicy and balsamic vanilla / benzoin odour, plus a touch of evernia type moss (oakmoss substitute). \n\r\nAn very appealing fragrance overall, especially the main body notes.",

			"content": "A bright green opening that reminds me of something like angelica: spiced, bright, zesty green. Very synthetic, but I enjoy the top. \n\r\nAfter that, sadly, it goes downhill for me. I get a quickly progressing melting plastic note that I've come to associate with overdoses of ambrox. It gets sweeter with a soft laundry-type musk going in the background, but that plastic ambrox accord just ruins things for me. \n\r\nOddly, this note is more evident in my sillage than sniffing up close. Every once in awhile I just get this sharp plastic waft. Putting that aside, this scent feels polished and streamlined, and those interested in such a take on a zesty green-fresh cologne maybe interested. ",

			"content": "The pitch of Sophie Labb\u00e9's creation for 2017 Speed Smelling is to compose an Eau de Cologne without actual citrus essences such as lemon or bergamot, but using ginger and elemi instead to recreate the citrus aspect, and coriander seed and pink pepper to supplement the spicy tonality. The resulting fragrance, at least to my amateur nose, is fairly convincing.\n\r\nWithout trying to dissect each note, upon spraying the fragrance, I can smell an invigorating burst of the lemon-y and fresh spiciness of ginger, the peppery and herbal of bergamot and a charming sappy verdency like crushing leaves between fingers, which perfectly conveys the refreshing sensation when applying an Eau de Cologne.\n\r\nThe fragrance then gradually loses its initial tonic energy and slightly sweetens with time. It also becomes more woody, a little bit powdery and more musky as well in its dry down. It mostly stays close to the skin, but its woody musky stage streches its longevity to at least 7 hours on my skin.\n\r\nOn the surface, this fragrance doesn't seem like a novelty, just a good standard Eau de Cologne with a noticeable ginger twist. But in light of its technical achievement, I find it quite successful and innovative. Although it evetually sizzles out into a soft woody musky skin scent in the dry down, I guess it's kind of unavoidable if now the longevity is an imperative demand even for Eau de Cologne type of fragrances, originally designed to be enjoyed at short moments.

As it opens up the floral aspects begin to come out and a really soft musk starts to appear behind everything. This is probably the most interesting stage of the fragrance and I actually really enjoyed it up through this point, but the dry down ended up being a generic white musk that left me wanting more.

Despite the write-up on this one saying that she didn't use any citrus, the elemi itself has a strong citrus presence like pressed lemon rind. Interwoven with the elemi is a crisp ginger note. In the mid-period, the fragrance turned slightly chalky or powdery and introduced notes of bergamot. The bergamot was on the sweeter side, but soon after hints of spice came in that I thought were close to cloves (the write-up indicates pink pepper...that's must be what read as cloves to me.) The skin scent drydown had a long tail, becoming sweeter and smoother over time. It was like a lavender/bergamot creamsicle with hints of sweet cloves. Very nice.",

Prolixe is unlike Aventus by having much more subtlety and softness in the dry down with more character in the opening notes. Cassis adds an interesting leverage point between the tart grapefruit and soft pineapple in the opening.  Saffron, cardamom, patchouli and leather yields a suede, cool and soft dry down.  The overall tone is mysterious and soft suede. The only note I can pick out that stands on its own is patchouli in the cool base. I like this scent quite a bit.   Similar fragrances in character and feel to Prolixe are Aventus, which is greener and Boadicea the Victorious Imperial which is a little heavier and more complex but has a similar opening as well as patchouli leather base.

The fragrance is somewhat of a contradiction of contrasting parts and it is really difficult for me to describe the overall character of this fragrance. The opening ginger and cardamom has a slight gourmand feel which is warmed by rose and olibanum in the heart.  This leads into patchouli, tobacco and oud which is a dark hay barn, tobacco leaf with oud base that has all of its oud character blended out by these complimentary notes.   The scent is a warm complex blend with slight influences from ginger, rose, patchouli, tobacco, oud, and cardamom.  I really enjoy all of these notes, but to my nose, this one doesn't come together into a completed unique fragrance.  It is a nice blend with little happening to object to but also not much to get excited about either.  I would rate Outrecuidant 6 of 10 stars.",

This is a very pleasant fragrance overall - not especially irreverent, but very wearable and all the aromas involved here have good memories attached to them.

A closer reading informed me that it was not Malaise, but Malaisie, the French name for Malaysia.\n\r\nFinding no references online to the scent\u2019s content, I went to the internet to learn the tropical florals (Hibiscus, Orchids, Frangipani Lantan, Rose, Rhododendron, Chrysanthemum, Bougainvillea) and fruits (Guava, Papaya, Mango, Pineapple, Strawberry) of Malaysia that could possibly be used in a floral tribute.\n\r\nSadly, none of these are identifiable to my nose. Malaisie is a superb leather, which starts out as a dry fruity floral with a leather undertone and dries down to the equivalent of the sweet leather notes of Knize Ten.\n\r\nAs such, my guess as to its note tree would be something like this:\n\r\nTop notes: Bergamot, Petitgrain, Mango\r\nHeart notes: Rose, Orris, Carnation\r\nHeart notes: Castoreum, Musk, Amber, Vanilla\n\r\nIt is quite unique and delicious.

			"content": "Fans of old galbanum-led green perfumes rejoice! This is the modern take on your beloved style, but obviously without the oakmoss chypre structure many of its forerunners had due to that little thing called IFRA. Instead, we're presented with a musky clean floral structure with a green leafy head note very similar to Annick Goutal Ninf\u00e9o Mio (2009) but much less intense and without the tomato leaf presence. The same unisex potential is present here thanks to the similar emphasis on earthy \"garden soil\" tones, just with a much stronger floral presence borrowed from the original Gucci Bloom (2017), which was primarily a tuberose and jasmine sambac scent over musk and wood itself. Alberto Morillas was also on board for this scent like he was the original Bloom, and much to the same degree, I felt like he dialed in the brief to present a sharper springtime variant of the old-school-meets-new-school character of the first scent in the line. Unlike the original Bloom, this does not mess with such a prominent and notorious floral as the almighty tuberose perfume, and therefore feels less divisive for it, but the prominent galbanum in the structure makes it feel like more of a throwback than the original, since modern mainstream florals have been away from this style for decades. Like with Ninf\u00e9o Mio, Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori (2018) will have it's strong but niche circle of fans, but it much less likely to be smelled on the street due to that sharp tomboyish green streak throughout. \n\r\nThe opening phases of Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori come in with that aforementioned galbanum with a bit of blackcurrant sweetness so it isn't stinging green like many of the older examples using the note. There is no shrill bergamot here or aldehydes either, just soft sweetness and sharp green notes whizzing around on top of the old tuberose and jasmine sambac accord lifted from the original Gucci Bloom. The fruity sweetness actually adds just enough juiciness to hide the fleshy facets of tuberose from view, and the honeysuckle accord further assists that in the heart alongside the pushed-down jasmine/tuberose tandem. The whole thing is very reminiscent of if one took a bit of Ninf\u00e9o Mio and crossed it with Eau de Cartier Concentr\u00e9e (2002), especially with the violet leaf-like note created by the way the galbanum plays with the star floral accord. The base of woody musk is infused with sandalwood to make it a bit smoother than the original Gucci Bloom, and a bit more natural in tone as well, but nothing extraordinary. Overall this is a less exciting, but friendlier and more-vibrant take on the Gucci Bloom theme, better suited to be shared across genders and used in the suggested spring time, but also across summer and early fall for day wear in casual settings. As with the original Gucci Bloom, Acqua di Fiori won't really appeal to modern noses hung up on fruity florals, fruitchoulis, or sweet gourmand woody amber and oriental perfumes, but for the left-of-center lot which can appreciate snappy semi-dry scent with an outdoorsy feel, this might work. Wear time is about average for something of this type, with medium sillage and sufficient longevity for a day.\n\r\nAnother possible candidate to try Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori is someone who isn't ready to dive head first into the niche world of tomato leaf perfumes like the Annick Goutal, vintage oakmoss paeans like those found at Patou, or hardcore green florals like Chanel No. 19 (1971), but still wants to experience this side of the fence with relative ease and affordability. I love green smells so this is right up my alley, but I am a bit biased towards anything with a nice grassy start so Acqua di Fiori \"had me at hello\" as it were. The original Gucci Bloom had some stiff competition both with tuberose perfumes of antiquity and high-end luxury/prestige selections that use obsessive quantities of the real absolute from the real flower, but this green flanker lives in a class sort of by itself outside of perfumes too old to be enjoyed by the mainstream, but not old enough to be considered \"timeless classics\" by the blow-hard tastemakers that do all the write-ups which decide for us what we're supposed to value. What this means is you can approach Acqua di Fiori knowing that you won't really smell like anyone else unless you're at a perfumista meetup, and if you're stuck working in the concrete jungle yearning for a day in the garden or at a park, this might be just the periodic mental vacation you need. To be quite honest, this scent should have been the pillar of the line, and the original Gucci Bloom made into a tuberose-themed flanker, as it feels more like a garden bloom than the original and lives up to its own packaging much better. Thumbs up.",

			"content": "The first few times I wore L\u2019Oudh, I wondered why it wasn\u2019t called L\u2019Vetiver, as a lovely, deep and sonorous vetiver seemed to be the star of the show. Vetiver is a noble perfumery ingredient in its own right, whose full range of expressiveness is rarely explored, but it comes at a much humbler price. \r\nPerhaps my 5 ml sample was still maturing and hadn\u2019t quite reached its full potential, but I am happy to report now that there is a good deal more than vetiver to this offering. While I find it still lacks the hypnotic quality that I long for in a good oud, it compensates with a heart-of-the-wood experience that seems completely natural and unforced. If you love woody perfumes, this is one you must try. \r\nL\u2019Oudh has a moreish mouldy and humid aspect to it during the first couple of hours, bittersweet, which complements the smokier side of the composition well. It has layer upon layer of woody tones, creamy soft like some sandalwood oils,  sharp and sweetish like some cedars, the salt tang of vetiver along with its earthier aspects, a pepperiness in common to some other ouds, shade upon shade they both comfort and tease the wearer. I don\u2019t sense the musky, beasty notes here and don\u2019t really miss them. \r\nI find L\u2019Oudh has a moderate projection and comes into its own much better in warmer weather. It\u2019s a kind of meditation on wood \u2013 and true to the nature of a meditation, while the experience is in constant flux (plenty of variation in the woody tones) the focus remains singular. \r\nThe later stages are somewhat less compelling for me as the wood becomes more sunbleached and salty. If you love perfumes in the vein of Sel de Vetiver, this will still float your boat.\n",

			"content": "Michael Kors isn't exactly a name that screams \"quality\" to fragrance enthusiasts. If the inaugural masculine release, Michael for Men (2001), still earns some respect, it has since become one of the houses in the Est\u00e9e Lauder stable that seems to have received the least investment and promotion, and new releases from the house turn up at discounters without much delay.\n\r\nHowever, there are interesting goings on at Est\u00e9e Lauder these days, and good fragrances seem to be creeping in in unexpected places (consider the surprising revival of Aramis with Tobacco Reserve and Special Blend, and then there's stuff like the bewilderingly bold MAC Shadescents line). So when I heard Extreme Speed was unexpectedly good, I wanted to give it a sniff.\n\r\nThe stupidly and blandly named Extreme Speed is not at all very \"extreme,\" but it is a rather nice, removed, formal release that feels a bit like an attempt to create a \"for the modern man\" synthsmooth take on the Grey Flannel brief by way of Tom Ford aesthetics.\n\r\nExtreme Speed opens with a blast of spice with some very prominent cardamom, which dances on top of a creamy, cool blend of woods and increasingly prominent violet. This is a dusty, dark, shadowy scent that starts cool and slightly warms as it moves into the late drydown. It's not very sweet and feels formal, so this is a mature-leaning creation.\n\r\nAnother way of describing Extreme Speed would be to say that Est\u00e9e Lauder built a fragrance around the violet note from Tom Ford Ombr\u00e9 Leather 16, which was absent from the 2018 variant of Ombr\u00e9 Leather. This is all about that dark, dry violet note, smoothed out with woods so that it isn't syrupy or fruity (no \"grape soda\" vibes here). If its aromatic effects were a bit more brazen, it wouldn't be hard to imagine this as a Tom Ford release, ala Ombr\u00e9 Violet.\n\r\nIf Extreme Speed isn't exactly an attention-grabbing stunner--it's an aloof and somewhat subtle creation--it's commendably solid designer fare that offers a unified, coherent composition and a distinctive feeling. Longevity is good with discreet protection and sillage (this is office scent material).",

			"content": "Blind-buying is always a risky proposition, and I was in a TJ Maxx and saw that they had Extreme Speed in a 4.1 oz bottle for $29.99.  Not being familiar with it, and looking up the note profile on basenotes while I was there in the store, I saw that ES has a few notes that I'm partial to; cardamom, violet, and cedarwood.  So, I figured \"what the hell\" and bought it.\n\r\nI really like it!  It opens up with a nice dose of cardamom, with the cypress and sage not as pronounced.  The violet is nicely represented, as well.  My worry was with the cinnamon, as perfumers sometimes go too heavy on it, and it creates a \"heating\" aspect to fragrances that I don't enjoy.  Luckily for me, the cinnamon is very restrained, and for that matter, not really noticeable.  The cedarwood is solid and the patchouli is also restrained; again, that's good for me as patchouli can easily overpower a fragrance if not reined in.  The tolu balsam gives this a very \"buttery\" feel to it that makes it both spicy, yet creamy and not too sharp.  During the drydown, the more pronounced cedarwood base is not too dissimilar to that of St. Kitts (2015) by Tommy Bahama, another well-done fragrance that can also be found in Marshalls/TJMaxx/Ross, etc.\n\r\nThe only thing I don't like about this fragrance is the name.  I have come to dread anything with \"extreme\" in the name, and \"speed\" is the last thing that comes to my mind when I smell this.  This is a much classier scent than its moniker suggests, and for the price I paid, I think it's a steal.\n\r\nThumbs up for this dark horse.",

I cannot put my finger on why, until I remember reading that some reviewers find this to be in the same ball park as Alien, another of Ropion's creations. Yes, this is like Alien, but done with orange blossom, instead of jasmine. Others have compared it to Seville a l'Aube (which I also own & love), but this is texturally different: it's more rounded, smooth & warm, without that fresh, almost sharp edge that Seville has. There is sweetness here as it dries down, provided by notes of honey, heliotrope & tonka, but it's not a heavy, syrupy sweetness as found in Lutens' Fleur d'Oranger. Instead, the heart is beautifully balanced by neroli, which prevents the sweetness from overwhelming the orange blossom in its starring role. There's no further development, but one spray of this extrait is still going softly after eleven hours.\r\nI have no regrets whatever on this blind buy, I just wish the bottle came with a cap. I hope it doesn't evaporate, because I wouldn't want to have to use up something this special too quickly.",

Clearly no problem with the sillage! The fuzzy floral note of mimosa quickly appears, & the fragrance begins to veer back & forth between powdery, musky florals & an accord of plastic, rubber, engine oil & perhaps WD40. Five hours in, it's all settled into a base of woods along with a metallic note, still with a faint hum of leather. It's still going strong after eight hours when I go for a shower, & several days later I can still clearly smell it on the sleeve of my robe. Apparently it's marketed as a \"garment perfume\", so that works.\r\nI can see the associations with that \"new car\" smell that others have commented on; a smell that has always made me nauseous since childhood. Hence my ambivalent reaction to this one: by turns I strongly dislike it, & then something about it intrigues me into thinking hey, I smell pretty good. It's probably not something I'd reach for, but it's certainly interesting & unique.",

			"content": "Club Design opens with a fizzy, petrichor-like humid earthy smell, as well as a pungently marine, almost fishy saltiness. The humid earthiness reminds me of the opening of Thierry Blondeau Narcisse Emoi, while the brash fishy note smells like a relative of Calone to me. Because of the pungency of the opening, and my struggle with most synthetic fishy marine notes, Club Design can be quite nauseating to me, unless on a hot day when the opening evaporates much more quickly. \n\r\nThe soft suede leather reveals itself on my skin usually around 2 hours in, and doesn't completely shake off the fizzy humid earthy aspect and pervasive fishy marine note until after about 5 hours. I can see the rubber/new car interior comparison, as the fragrance is indeed quite artifical-smelling for a leather-themed perfume, but more on an overall, abstract level. On a more specific detail level, I'd agree more with the comparison to Herm\u00e8s Galop, as the suede in both perfumes shares this chewy texture similar to turkish delight to me, as well as an abstract musky fruity undertone. However, the fruity syrup in Galop is replace by fake petrichor and artificial marine notes here at first, and then by a more heightened medicinal bitterness of saffron later on. \n\r\nWhen those artifical-smelling opening notes completely disappear in the late dry down, Club Design is indeed quite comfortable as a sleek suede skin scent, flankered by a discreet musky fruity woody cedar to my nose. The sillage is usually moderate on my skin, while the longevity is often 8-9 hours with one good spray.\n\r\nMy opinions on Club Design have been constantly swinging left and right during those a few weeks when I wore it. At first I was instantly repulsed by the difficult opening notes, then I began to doubt whether its artificality is actually a masterstroke, and again I question myself if I'd given Club Design a second thought if it had come out from a brand with a much lower profile than the Zoo, and again and again. But then, when I compare it to other perfumes that play around the idea of artificiality, such as Vaporocindro and Dinudisit by January Scent Project, Womanity by Thierry Mugler, La Fin du Monde by Etat Libre d'Orange, Club Design doesn't feel as compelling as them to me. \n\r\nWhile I was initially taken aback by most of them, the dissonance between unabashedly synthetic elements and more natural-smelling elements soon evolves into an unexpected harmony as well as a fascinating, complex puzzle that draws me in. But Club Design just feels like layering an elegant suede perfume with openly synthetic elements to make it more \"edgy\". The suede skin scent is proper, the synthetic petrichor and marine notes are provocative, and a salty suede leather skin scent has great potential, but the end result in Club Design doesn't seem to elevate the idea beyond individual elements. \n\r\nAs a side note, I only tested Club Design on my skin, but haven't yet tried it as a fabric scent as it's intended (apparently its coumarin and safranal exceeds the upper limit for a skin perfume according to the official website). It's possible that it might work better on fabric, but as a personal perfume, I would only recommend Club Design if you're looking for a scent reminiscent of \"new car interior\" with an unapologetically synthetic vibe.

Leather, but clean, a bit industrial and modulated by light and wheezy air-conditioning. I find the subtle aquatics used here are a master stroke, making the whole thing transparent but without succumbing to the waterboarding tendency. \r\nI find it a fun, sparkling thing, which is rarely my reaction to leathers. It revels in artifice and pulls off the factory-fresh impression with great aplomb. Come to think of it, there\u2019s also a whiff of yarns of new fabric being unravelled for the shopper\u2019s inspection (also a childhood memory). Its straightforward but vague floral notes dance about in the mix without breaking the overall impression of manufactured goods. \r\nIt\u2019s quite a linear perfume, only losing a bit of the freshness in the wearer\u2019s perception over time. So even though I feel the trick it pulls off is brilliant, I actually quite like that it dies down after about 3-4 hours enabling me to wear something else, because fresh leather all day is not my idea of fun.  \n",

			"content": "Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008) helped revitalize the then-sagging name of Paco Rabanne in the eyes of mainstream male fragrance consumers. The brand hadn't really had a true successor to the smash hit of Paco Rabanne Pour Homme (1973), even if XS Pour Homme (1993) and Ultraviolet Man (2001) had some minor success of their own, milked further by armies of flankers. 1 Million has had some of its own flankers as well, with 1 Million Lucky (2018) being the second attempt at a more casual iteration of the main line, following 1 Million Cologne (2015) in that regard. We don't know who the perfumer is on this little ditty, but we do know that they took some notes from Azzaro because this could be a distant cousin to Azzaro Wanted (2013). To keep this concise, what you get in a bottle of 1 Million Lucky is a hazelnut-inflected gourmand-ish casual workplace iteration of the original Paco Rabanne 1 Million, freed from heavy blood orange tones and sweet woody amber richness. Of course, the expected \"ambroxan bomb\" base riff is present, but here it is not so leg-out like in so many late 2010's contemporaries. Is it enough to win your heart? That's up to you.\n\r\nThe opening of 1 Million Lucky is that aforementioned hazelnut note, mixed with some ginger (recalling Azzaro Wanted), lemon, and grapefruit. The slight sweetness present here is nowhere near as stifling as the original 1 Million can sometimes be, and the scent quickly merges into a plum-like accord furthering the food association, with a brief booziness like a fruit liqueur that ends up drying a bit once a cedar note appears. The ambroxan-fueled base is also stuffed with denatured \"white patchouli\", or the olfactory equivalent to food-service mayonnaise in my opinion, meant to add body and thickness without really giving any flavor of it's own. The white patchouli here also reminds me a bit of Obsessed for Men by Calvin Klein (2017), but without any vanilla to help give it some texture, making me feel like 1 Million Lucky is just empty calories with an ambroxan base by the final drydown. This last part is a real shame for me, as everything was going along so well up until the scent falls apart in the end, but the top notes do come back now and again. Wear time is average for the category at 8+ hours. and this is still no summer fragrance, but at least in median weather you can pull this off without asphyxiating anyone.\n\r\n1 Million Lucky fills a niche in the lineup of \"fall/spring casual day use\" that I don't think the line really needed, since the gaudy gold bar and the heady juices of past flankers (outside the wrecking ball that is the original) all just imply that this is a \"party time\" scent where excess is expected. The 1 Million Cologne flanker is still the better casual warm weather option, since the marine notes in it and the slightly-crisper finish basically make it an aquatic version of the original, even if that concept in and of itself may be limited in appeal. Still, if you wanted a lighter and more apologetic version of 1 Million which has some neat nutty creamy things going on in the development, this might not be a bad option, especially if you're a fanatic for the line, but I just can't find this satisfying enough considering the collapse into singular base notes at the end. I consider myself \"lucky\" for being able to test this without blind-buying it for the tacky packaging like I did the original, so there's that I guess. I give this a neutral, but your opinion may vary so I suggest testing this, since it shouldn't be hard to find at any major department store or retail cosmetics chain, at for the first few years after release until Paco Rabanne hits us with another flanker.",

The latter mentioned is so outrageously overpriced I only buy samples when absolutely necessary. \n\r\nAnyway, here's my first review. I have no idea what I'm  talking about (many of you have unbelievably nuanced noses - and my nose is out-of-joint with jealousy) but writing reviews has always been fun for me and, let me tell you, this 1 Million Lucky journey was quite the thrill ride!\n\r\n---\n\r\nHi. Newbie here, and I thank this august membership for your expertise.\n\r\nI have learned a lot!\n\r\nNow, I do not claim to have an advanced olfactory system but, other than the late powder, I did not experience much of what others have mentioned here.\n\r\nMy 1  Million Lucky arrived today. I got a 100 mil. bottle on Amazon for 60 bucks and could not resist the bargain. Have been looking for an Aventus substitute (nothing qualifies as a true clone, I've found) and this fragrance came highly recommended.\n\r\nFirst blast was just that - an almost overwhelming gale of The Pineapple Express. Wow! Felt like I was swimming in a pi\u00f1a colada without the colada. Aventus has a decent (and MUCH subtler) pineapple note at first but that note calms down very quickly into Creed's sublime, complex underthemes. After the pineapple, the Rabanne fragrance grew even more sugary - I was reminded of these little candies, Smarties, that I used to eat as a kid. This made for a nice sense memory but the fragrance's profile was not terribly masculine. Then, for a moment there, the pineapple morphed into what I can only describe ROTTEN pineapple: you know, as if the pineapple rind you threw away three days ago came jumping out of the trash and started pursuing you menacingly around your home? \n\r\nNot pretty.\n\r\n3 hours hence, the fragrance has calmed down considerably and, while the pineapple is still quite prevalent, there's also some remaining candy and, as aforementioned, a LOT of powder.\n\r\nSo, to recap: Robust pineapple-infused nuclear detonation settles into nostalgic children's candy, decays (half-life?) into pineapple corpse, which, bless\u00e9dly, gives way to a pretty nice pineapplecandypowder.\n\r\nThis strikes me as a unisex scent, though I've not seen that mentioned anywhere. Perhaps I'll spray some on my girlfriend and see what happens.\n\r\nOkay, bye!\n\r\nShnozz Rating: 7/10",

			"content": "This is either a good scent or it's just my perfect guilty pleasure because I've really been enjoying wearing it. Right out of the gate it's very sweet and immediately seems like a gourmand version of 1 Million. The hazelnut accord is actually very nice and smells just like when you inhale the aroma from a bag of hazelnut coffee (minus any real coffee smell). It adds a nice, roasted quality to the composition. Behind the hazelnut, there's some freshness, provided by the plum notes, which aside from being fresh are also a bit juicy and fruity-sweet. As a result, they're a nice, cooling complement to the hazelnut. Finally, the other most prominent smell is honey, which comes on a little bit later in its development, maybe about half an hour in. The honey, flanked by a subtle and sweet floral note, sits atop the rest of the composition, almost like a glaze, and it gives it a fragrant, aromatic characteristic, which diffuses nicely in its projection. Apparently there's grapefruit somewhere in the scent, but I don't exactly pick up on it. I think it really serves more to uplift the plum. The plum accord in Lucky isn't a deep, dark plum note like in Plum Japonais or John Varvatos, it's much brighter, and that's where I think the grapefruit comes into play. So for the first half of Lucky you have this pleasing interplay between the hazelnut accord, the plum, and the honey. When I first smelled this I imagined some kind of elaborate dessert--a cake almost like Tiramisu, but with different ingredients of fruit and honey and roasted nuts. But what's nice about Lucky is that it doesn't completely go into the direction of a dessert and maintains its fresher aspects as well. \n\r\nAll of this goes on for a while (2 or 3 hours) before moving into the second half and settling into its base. Lucky's base is not as interesting as the opening--it's basically the residual sweetness of the previous half combined with that sort of fuzzy/scratchy dry synthetic cashmeran wood which is so prominent in the base of many fragrances today. I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of this accord, and it's ruined a few fragrances for me in the past (Aqua Atlantique, for example). But while I felt it was totally out of place in Atlantique, a fresh aquatic with bergamot and marine notes in the opening, it feels like a more natural transition here, moving from Lucky's sweet, dessert-like beginning to this base of fuzzy woods. Some of the nuttiness hangs on too, which adds another dimension to the woods and makes them a little more interesting and tolerable than they'd be all by themselves. So I'm sort of forgiving of the woods base here, as I feel the first half has already presented a spectacular show, and also because it seems to fit better into the overall picture with Lucky than it does in some other scents. It gets a pass. \n\r\nWhile 1 Million Lucky certainly isn't subtle, or even very refined, I don't find it crass or ignorant either. It's fun, and a bit loud, but it's also pretty well balanced and cleverly put together (at least in the first half). What counts most is that it smells really good for a decent amount of time and it performs well...just a few good sprays of this and you're set for a while. Its age range is wide. I'm pushing 40 and enjoy it, but I can definitely see a younger crowd liking it too. And as far as seasons and weather go, nothing's off limits. The warm roasted hazelnut makes it a good choice for fall or winter, and at the same time, Lucky absolutely shines on summer evenings. I'd classify it as a casual scent or a date scent. Overall, this gets a definite thumbs up and a final rating of 8 out of 10. I'm tempted to make it an 8.5.\n\r\nSide note: Avoid this like the plague if you are averse to sweet scents, popular modern mainstream scents, and especially, popular modern mainstream scents for men that are sweet. If you hate Invictus, Code Profumo, Wanted, Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme, etc. then stay far away from Lucky because you will certainly hate it too. However, if you don't mind modern sweet scents for men, and even enjoy some of them, then this is worth sniffing out. If you're a fan of Ferragamo Uomo, then I think you'll definitely love this. In some ways Lucky reminds me of Uomo, but I find Lucky a much better scent overall, with more clearly defined notes and concepts.",

			"content": "1 Million Lucky is another loud flanker from the ever-loud 1 Million series from Paco Rabanne. While the previous flanker released, Prive, was a more subtly winter take on the original composition, and perhaps the biggest departure to date from the original formula, Lucky is a nod to the sweet-toothed (nosed?) lovers of the sweetness of the original but not its bubblegum centricity. I fall into this category, as I like that the original 1 Million is sweet, but I don't prefer HOW it is sweet. Lucky replaces the bubblegum vibe with featured notes of hazelnut and plum, sweetening the mix in a semi-dessert way rather significantly, though the result is neither particularly nutty nor fruity.\n\r\nThese highlights do blend well with the amber and woods that constitute the bulk of the rest of the fragrance, and it becomes a more modest fragrance after several hours of drying down. Performance is excellent, on par with the rest of the line, and it can already be found on grey market sites and other discounters (like Marshalls, TJ Maxx, etc. in the US) so the retail $88 for 100ml need not be paid.\n\r\nSome might find it redundant, but I regard it a thoroughly sweet a dessert-like departure in the line that pleasantly explores what would result from making 1 Million a bit more cavity-inducing. Not for everyone, certainly, but quite for me, and perhaps my second favorite entry in the line after Absolutely Gold.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

			"content": "Sometimes I feel bad for being perhaps less-picky or \"discerning\" as the hoity-toity segment might say, giving a vastly greater number of positive reviews to neutral or negative ones. I have a wide palette, and I enjoy both challenging and easy-going scents, expensive or cheap. Hell, I don't even care if you use plastic bottles (hello Pinaud), so long as there's no perceivable dip in my enjoyment. However, scents like Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Italian Zest Pour Homme (2018) not only come across like reciting a long-winded name of a race horse only to deliver an astonishingly plain product inside, but can't even be true to their own name by giving an experience that at least matches their description. I went in expecting a zesty fragrance in the Italian style, thinking maybe Dolce & Gabbana got their s**t together and blended in the Light Blue Pour Homme (2007) base with the bright amalfi lemon and tangy herbs of glorious past Italian masculines like Versace L'Homme (1984) or Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 for Man (1987). Hell, even the Italian-by-proxy Aramis Tuscany Per Uomo (1984) was a really good presentation of the aesthetic and could have given D&G a good reference point, but nope. Nada. Zilch. Negative. Instead, we get what is basically lemon Pellegrino on top of Light Blue Pour Homme, with what little sweetness the original had sucked completely out. If this sold for $15 out of an Avon catalog as a quirky cheap summer thrill, I'd be giving it a thumbs up, but since they want prices only a few dollars away from Chanel for this, I'm highly displeased.\n\r\nDolce & Gabbana Light Blue Italian Zest Pour Homme (gesundheit) starts with grapefruit, manadarin, lemon, no... that's not right. It smells like lemon S. Pellegrino sparkling water tastes so let's not sugar-coat it. Even the salesperson at Nordstrom warned me it smells like \"lemon Italian soda\", to which I couldn't believe and had to spray. Sure enough, that initial reaction was one of disbelief and laughter as we were both covered in a cloud of evervescent lemon. After that, Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Italian Zest Pour Homme (let me catch my breath) moves into \"freshie 101\" territory by using garden-variety heart notes that lead me to believe this was a college thesis for somebody who graduated from Givaudan School of Perfumery bought up by D&G for a cheap summer quickie. Juniper, rosemary, Sichuan pepper, and rosewood yawn into each other to form a genetic piquant \"meh\" which sandwiches our lemon soda to the standard Light Blue Pour Homme base of incense, musk, and a sliver of oakmoss. I wasn't too keen on the original Light Blue Pour Homme either as it too was very boring and with extremely poor performance, yet commanded top designer dollar alongside Diors and Herm\u00e8s selections. And hey, some others in this price point can have weak sillage and poor longevity too, like Eau d'Orange Verte (1979), but at least they're interesting. With Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Italian Zest Pour Homme, we have a poor-performing but harmless aquatic transformed into something laughably absurd. If you were trying to get a chuckle out of me D&G, mission accomplished. Well done. Bravo.\n\r\nI'm sure the novelty factor of this is enough for some people to enjoy, and if I came across it cheaply, I might toss a bottle in the back of a dark oubliette somewhere to bring out when I want to play a gag on my friends, but as it is, this stuff is a serious waste of cash and time for both the person who wears it, the person who composed it, and the house who commissioned it's creation. When one factors in other flankers like Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme Intenso (2015) and Dolce & Gabbana The One for Men Grey (2018), a picture is painted of Dolce & Gabbana being a house deathly afraid to move beyond their past pillars but also not really knowing where to go next in order to retain some clout in the rapid-fire relevance game the mid-tier designer male fragrance segment has become, presenting choices which are \"safe yet different\" to everyone's chagrin. I mean look at how hard their attempt at a niche-level collection flopped... Anyway, one thing is for certain, and that's this Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Pour Homme flanker has about as much Italian zest as a pint of gellato bought from the grocery store. I really hope they can at least bang out something new and more interesting than this, even if it has to be another flanker, because as it stands, the most noteworthy masculines from the house are a minimum decade old, and I'm not even a hardline vintage guy. Sorry, can't even give this one a neutral, but at least it proves that I don't actually like everything I smell, if that was ever in question from the start. Hard pass.",

			"content": "Avon dabbled in aquatics throughout the nineties, but let's be honest: who didn't? Everyone wanted the next Cool Water (1988) and it was only because Avon was going through a nutty period of creative waywardness that they didn't flood the market with them like everyone else did. Instead, Avon would wait until the 2000's and the \"second wave\" aquatic boom spearheaded by stuff like Polo Blue (2002) to really sling out the blue juices to their unsuspecting catalog customers. Folks who follow Avon history will know that 1999-2011 was a period of expansion and creative renaissance for the company, which didn't ultimately lead to sales and caused them to implode and retreat from the US as their primary market afterward, but that's not what this review is about. Avon was releasing an obscene amount of new product every year in the 2000's, even by their old standards of one, then two new scents every year, retiring slow sellers just as often, but by the time Peak Zone hit in 2002, Avon was introducing sometimes close to a half-dozen new scents for men alone (let alone their larger women's selections), so it kinda feels like this was lost in the fray before it ever had a chance to really prove itself. You had the \"chypres\" Avon was dabbling with since the beginning of the decade, a few gourmand-themed scents trickling out, and even separate lines of designer-endorsed, athlete-endorsed, musician-endorsed, and actor/actress-endorsed scents. Amidst all this bonkers expansion, a series of comparatively dry, airy aquatics also hit market, starting with Coastline (2001), then Individual Blue earlier in the year that this was released, then followed by this scent, then  RPM the following year (KM/H and Full Speed for Latin and European markets), RPM Intense (2004), Blue Rush (2005), then finally Interact and the Derek Jeter Driven (2006) line until new ideas were explored.\n\r\n Peak Zone is a link in the chain of this idea's progression, and very comparable to everything listed, but it has it's own quirks that honestly make me prefer it most. For starters, Peak Zone was a bit less-pretentious than some of the later aquatics in this series, and it came in a 100ml/3.4oz size when many Avon aquatics were of the 75ml/2.5oz variety for the same price. Peak Zone's bottle design was less \"notice me Senpai\" than many aquatics in this series, and had the least fanfare of all of them, as if Avon added it as a B-side to it's masculines that they rather you buy over it, which gives Peak Zone a bit of an underdog quality. The scent itself built on the dry citrus, aqueous florals, and musks foundation served up by precious entries in the series, but unlike the earlier Individual Blue or later Blue Rush, had it's own sort of juicy top note that blended differently with the rest of the notes, and was quite a bit more green overall than it's cousins. Peak Zone opens with grapefruit, some soft mint, with bergamot bolstering the opening as can be expected. The middle of eucalyptus, iris and cyclamen is a transition to the cedar, sandalwood, white musk, and vetiver base. It goes on dry, stays cool, gets a little warmer into the dry down, then finishes crisp and green, with a juice that isn't -entirely- blue to give away that it isn't just another Cool Water clone. Avon was fond of introducing amber and peppercorn to it's later aquatics, so this is an interesting amber-free twist that remains lighter and almost more floral and feminine if not for the betraying base. Peak Zone smells like something that would be best used during workouts, outdoor adventures, and day-running, and I can't say that I'd want to wear it elsewhere.\n\r\nPeak Zone lasted all of 2 years in the catalogs, and was only released in the US market, making it more rare than most released at this time but not as rare as the \"single campaign\" scent Coastline, which was the first in this little run and fetches stupid prices for being an Avon that people actually liked but didn't live long enough to go around. Peak Zone is slightly less painful in the aftermarket when it pops up, but be prepared to pay designer prices for a cologne that once retailed for under $20 new, so only dedicated Avon fans need apply here. It also oddly sells very quickly when listed, surprisingly quicker than many sought-after discontinued designers, making me believe that there is a cult following for this. Peak Zone is definitely no unicorn in the realm of vintage fragrance, but it's startling to see it selling for 3 to 4 times what much older and less common Avon vintages fetch, so I can't recommend it based on it's scent, despite being quite good for what it is. The only thing close to this is the also-discontinued Izod by Izod (2008), which is going to push three figures because it was popular before it got axed, so if you -really- want this kind of dry citrus/mint/woods/musk synthetic accord, this might be the cheaper alternative after all. Peak Zone is another example of Avon doing things just a tad differently than everyone else in the 2000's, and it's a damn shame all their efforts didn't pay off, but after 2 decades of floundering, no amount of forward-thinking could bounce them back. I'd still rather wear anything they made at the time over the legions of candy-sweet nadir littering the masculine fragrance scene in the first decade of the new millennium. So, in that sort of legacy perspective, Peak Zone was a success after all, in spite of it's budget-bin design. If you find yourself in possession of a bottle by happenstance, you'll love it on those 90 degree days. ",

It is intoxicating it is Assam Oud it is honey,Benzoin \r\nLabdanum,possibly a touch of some Galbanum. Now... that said I love oud on its own and it mixed with other notes ingredients. Depending on mood. This hits all those spots. The oud in Ceylon is a sweaty horse and saddle with hay and figs. Barnyardy this oud... I love oud! This type of oud on its own most people wouldn\u2019t like it,those who aren\u2019t into oud or never tried oud. But I can see this oud being loved by a lot of people because being mixed with the notes I listed above. I can picture the oud turning some off but still intrigued and addicted by this oud and vanillic,honeyed vibe & keep coming back to this addicting fragrance. It\u2019s like one of those bad smells that you don\u2019t like but kinda do in a way. But keep wanting to smell it, if that makes sense.But me I love it ALL! you got this great Assam oud mixed with a Gourmand touch.  Wife hates Oud lol but she digs this one. I don\u2019t care if I need to take out a mortgage for more of this. I\u2019m getting a few bottles more. If this is ever discontinued I will start a riot... lol love it. Great...Great....

Bad news because this a perfume priced for the filthy rich.\r\nIf you\u2019re still reading, here\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\r\nCeylon is a dusky and caressing, musky oud, with an enrapturing, oozy utmost tender sweetness (quite unlike the syrupy horror that is Al-Khatt which shares the honey note in the Oud Stars collection)  reminiscent of noble rot in a rare s\u00e9lection de grains nobles bottle with hints of the wine cellar in which it lay maturing. Yet there is nothing dingy or dark about Ceylon, instead it glows gently from within, the softest, honeyed, misted light. Yes, the oud is somewhat leathery and animalic, but is so harmoniously integrated that it is worth a try even for people afraid of such things. Somehow, I can\u2019t help thinking this is what Auphorie were aiming for with their now-vaulted Musk Oud Maharaja: the similarities are striking, but Ceylon is the more multi-dimensional creation, the one that makes me want to lie back and dream.\r\nHowever, perceptions are a funny thing. While I was drifting off to my own little scented paradise, thinking this is as mellow as a welcoming hearth, in walked my beloved, who after a dramatic about-to-faint buckling of the knees declared that the perfume I was wearing had smacked him in the face \u2013 \u201cpaff\u201d.\n\n",

			"content": "Another flanker only by the name. Except for the itchy bergamot opening (which is what I dislike most in Shalimar, it\u2019s got nearly no similarity with Shalimar, or even with souffle de parfum, or souffle intense. This one is a very fruity floral. Very lovely but cannot be compared. I\u2019m happy with the sample. \n\r\nI had the chance to test Shalimar EDP (current version), Shalimar Souffle de Parfum and buy a 70s vintage version Shalimar, the first version of Ode \u00e0 la Vanille, sur la Route de Madagascar and sur la Route du Mexique. \n\r\nThe current Shalimar EDP was a bit disappointing. A lot of bergamot with some cardamom and then a powdery rose (almost itchy). Then it settles down finally but doesn't give a good sillage. What's funny is that it smells different if you smell it one cm away from another spot. \n\r\nShalimar from the 70s is so much better. Both softer and spicier, with an amber, cashmere feel. You get the bergamot and the rose, but nothing is too strong. \n\r\nSouffle de parfum shouldn't be compared. This is not Shalimar, don't expect Shalimar. There are some common notes, especially if you wear vintage Shalimar on the other wrist. But it's very good on its own! A wonderful floral with some spices and a gourmand dry-down. I get a lot of mandarine. I'm happy I randomly got a sample of this and I hope I'll get a full bottle. Sillage could be better, though.\n\r\nI tried Souffle Intense at Guerlain's shop in Brussels. I had one on each wrist. It shares notes with the original Souffle de Parfum, which I liked a lot. But it's very different in the same time. More fruit (citrus-mandarine), more vanilla. Sillage is very good and longevity is way better. I was going to buy the original, but I will go back for Souffle Intense.\r\nI still have no idea what 'pungent jade' smells like. \n\n\r\nThe original Ode \u00e0 la Vanille opens in a very bitter way. It's balsamic. Then it goes towards a powdery bergamot. The acid vanilla comes later. It's a bit sweeter than the vintage Shalimar but quite similar in the dry down. It also has more fruit. \n\r\nSur la Route de Madagascar shares a lot of notes as well, but it's more floral than fruity. It's more animalistic. Dirtier in a very sexy way. It has more vanilla than the others as well. \n\r\nSur la Route du Mexique opens with more pepper. It's something between rhum and gin, with spices. It might have a more itchy, synthetic feel for me.\n\r\nNote that the three bottles are exactly the same. You've got to keep the boxes to differentiate them. \n\r\nThe opening of all those Shalimar, except for souffle de parfum, is the biggest difference. The more they dry, the most similar they get. ",

It\u2019s a blurry, cool olfactory sensation, immediately recognizable, pleasant enough but difficult to give any kind of form.\r\nFrom the opening we are greeted by a surge of the familiar milky base that Duchaufour loves before one perceives the iris theme. Points of interest are a cedar and angelica accord that imparts a dry saltiness, almost like a precise and minute dose of fenugreek, and the sharpish rose in the heart which slightly clashes with the overall composition at first until it becomes downy and soft like posh baby powder some hours down the line. My feelings for Niral do grow warmer after about half a day\u2019s wear when the rose-iris integration in a kind of olfactory milkshake is finally achieved and the perfume emanates from my person like an aura. But for large parts of its life Niral is a big yawn, the kind of effort worthy of the old schoolteacher\u2019s admonition \u2013 \u2018Must try harder\u2019.

			"content": "Champ de Baies is a rather straightforward red berries solinote fragrance on me. \n\r\nWhen sprayed on skin, the fruity sweetness of blackberry and raspberry immediately takes charge. Unfortunately, none of the earthy green tartness of rhubarb or any other vegetal elements come through. Maybe it's because of the eau de cologne concentration, or the lack of a prominent caramel note, the fruity sweetness of red berries thankfully doesn't feel too saccharine. However, Champ de Baies is still pretty monotonous throughout its wear.\n\r\nA clean patchouli pops up here and there with time, but it's mainly a meek cedar-white musk raft that the red berries latch on in the dry down. Champ de Baies now essentially smells like the dry down of the 2006 Nina by Nina Ricci on my skin, albeit slightly more refined and less sweet. \n\r\nThe longevity of Champ de Baies is around 6-7 hours on me, and it stays rather close to skin for the most time.\n\r\nWhile the first two instalments of L'Artisan's Cologne series seemingly aim at reinventing eau de cologne, Champ de Baies no longer adheres to the structure, but is more like a diluted version of a conventional sweet red berries-clean musk fragrance. It's surely a pretty perfume, but not necessarily remarkable among the crowded fruity floral genre. I'd recommend it to those who enjoy the dry down of Nina Ricci Nina, but find the first few hours too sweet and have more budget.",

			"content": "Even though they're not listed in the pyramid, Champ de Fleurs strikes me as a foremost tuberose-gardenia fragrance. The initial opening of the softly bitter grapefruit pith quickly reveals the fleshy heart of tuberose and gardenia. The creamy sweetness is very restrained here, so much so that it feels almost like a nutty sweetness when the cedar starts to whisper in the background later on. The cheese-like butteriness of gardenia purrs quietly under the blanket of clean white musk, just enough to provide a certain intrigue but far from threatening the overall lighthearted mood of the fragrance.\n\r\nThe sillage of Champ de Fleurs is mostly intimate, and it lasts around 6-7 hours on me.\n\r\nI initially thought of Champ de Fleurs as very similar to La Chasse aux Papillons EDT - one of the most successful L'Artisan Parfumeur offerings, and last year's Roger & Gallet Tub\u00e9reuse H\u00e9donie, all three composed by Anne Flipo. After comparing them side by side, I still think that they're interchangeable to a certain extent, as all three share the similar tuberose heart and all three fill the same spot of a pretty, girl-next-door type of tuberose fragrance. But there are still noticeable differences, with Tub\u00e9reuse H\u00e9donie being the closest to a tuberose soliflore, exchanging the buttery cheese aspect of gardenia with the vegetal and somewhat chalky undertone of tuberose, while the hay-like nuance of linden blossom in La Chasse aux Papillons becomes much more apparent in comparison. As a result, Champ de Fleurs turns out to be more creamy, more musky and less vegetal, even though marginally so. It's certainly a very wearable, everyday type of tuberose fragrance. Adequate for sure, but I'm afraid it doesn't have much anything new to say, and I doubt it would make much impression to hardcore tuberose fans.",

I also get a small hint of AdP Intensa. The Vanilla is big but not to tacky and sickly sweet. This is wonderful. Hard to describe but if you like that Benzoin,Vanillic vibe in Givenchy Pi, Guerlain Boise d\u2019 Armenie and like the clean super clean almost white musk vibe in AdP Assoluta then this is yours. a highly opulent, better, higher quality version.

Dynamite sexy stuff this is! The wife loves it and she hates about 85% of what I wear from my collection of decants.

I generally haven't connected well with fig-laden fragrances, as much as I've wanted to embrace them (like Yesterday Haze by Imaginary Authors, for one) but in Grange I find the blend of the fig and tobacco to be one of contradiction working well. The tobacco tempers the quirkiness of the fig and the fig adds some sweetness to the tobacco.\n\r\nThe oak and cedar in the heart provide the woody roots of the fragrance that anchor it further in a real outdoorsy feel.\n\r\nEven with its sweet and woody side, Grange for me feels like more of a fragrance I would wear outdoors in warmer weather, or perhaps as a comfort fragrance of sorts.\n\r\nGrange, like Blyss, is a great value for an extrait de parfum, at $85 for 50ml, and it's nice to know one is getting dense juice even if it's (deliberately) not a projection monster.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

The violets are surrounded by blackberries and cherry and sweetened by jasmine into a thick fruit punch smell.  This is topped by Florabotanica-inspired mint, and the whole thing is smothered in a green tea essential oil note.\n\r\nThere are definitely some elements I find problematic, and it's mostly because of that green tea note.  It's kind of milky, so the faux candy fruit mixing with the tea kind of smells like Froot Loops cereal in sour milk.  Meanwhile, there's a concentration issue as well.  One of the great ironies of perfume is that increasing the amount of essential oils in a blend adds richness and a feel of expensiveness up until it reaches a tipping point, at which the high concentration makes the mix smell like a cheap homemade street fair candle.  X Twist Mate Tea hovers right around that tipping point, occasionally impressing me with really nice jasmine, and other times just smelling like a discount spa air freshener.\n\r\nThat being said, as much as I kind of don't like this, the base is really interesting.  We've smelled ionone suede drydowns enriched with vanilla and musks in countless Cuir de Russie perfumes, but the addition of the milky tea is actually quite genius, bringing out the tea's hidden animalic qualities while adding a surprising hint of green to an otherwise familiar base.\n\r\nSo, in all, I think there's cleverness happening here, but my general dislike of both fruity florals and green tea essence drags this down to a neutral rating...",

			"content": "What a great surprise! \n\r\nThe top is leaning masculine. Despite being listed in the base, I get a very nice round, warm oud-ish wood note right at the opening. It's clearly a synthetic oud accord, but more realistic than in other designer fragrances (YSL M7 Oud Absolu or Versace Oud Noir, to cite just a couple). I also spot a shy cacao note in the background, like in L'Instant de Guerlain. Here, Molinard seems to take the same approach as Acqua di Parma, by balancing traditionally warmer/heavier notes with fresh ones: in this case a sharp bergamot, that will keep an aldehydic touch from top to base. Great start!\r\nThe heart is totally unisex. After 15-30 mins, it morphs toward an excellent ballet of nutmeg, verbena, lavender, chili pepper and saffron, in which each note is individually noticeable (note that black pepper is unaccurately listed in the heart notes instead of chili peppers).\r\nThe base leans feminine. After an hour, it softens, and the base notes (vanilla, sandalwood and patchouli) give a great impression of suede leather, with a hint of smoke.\n\r\nWomen should not be scared to wear that one: despite oud and leather notes are listed in the pyramid, it's not at all a \"masculine woody/leather\" fragrance (unlike Dior Fahrenheit or TF Tuscan Leather for example).\r\nThe only drawback is the very low performance (skin scent after a few minutes, and a 2 hours longevity), and thus the use of moisturizer as well as heavily overspraying with a double-layer is recommended - if not required - to get just a soft/moderate projection and 7 to 9 hours of longevity. This is one of the \"I wish it had a better performance\" shelf, like Pal Zileri Sartoriale for example... in that hypothetical case, both would have been in the masterpiece category.\n\r\nWhile Molinard usually targets more the feminine crowds, here it delivers a totally unisex (and fantastic) oud-y/fresh/spicy suede fragrance. At just $40 online, it's a steal!\n\r\nImo, it's best worn in Spring and Fall, maybe even in moderatly warm summertime, thanks to the bergamot. It may be preferable to pull it off during evenings, but I can totally see women wearing this one also during the day, in office (low projection is a strength in this case). 30+.\n\r\nMy first buy from Molinard, and for sure not the last one. Despite the bad performance, congratulations to C\u00e9lia Lerouge (in-house perfumer and chief executive of Molinard) for this great scent! (And the very sexy commercial campaign in which she puts her face... and not only)\n\n",

			"content": "Byredo is known for their \"scent memory\" fragrances, as the very name itself is a portmanteau of \"by redolence\", but sometimes they can be rather hit or miss. Such is the case of the strictly-limited Elevator Music (2018), which consists of only 200 bottles worldwide in collaboration with clothing brand Off-White, and is even more expensive than the standard range. My take on Elevator Music is it gets the point across of being benign almost to the point of banal, and a hodge-podge of common designer/prestige accords like what you'd expect to smell if 5 different people all wearing fragrance stepped out of an elevator that you just boarded. I see the quirk appeal for hardcore fans of the brand, but outside enjoying the creative exercise on display, I just don't get the point of wearing this.\n\r\nElevator Music opens with Jasmine hedione and a sharp, almost abrasive chemical note that really takes the breath away. After a while, we settle into some synthetic woodyambers and a semi-aquatic violet accord very similar in texture to Creed Green Irish Tweed (1985). It's at this point Elevator Music smells most like what it claims to be: a cloud of plastic, metal, perfume trails, and heat. The base is a mishmash of rhubarb and Iso E Super, ambroxan and ambrette seed, tugging between modern masculine and feminine tropes but congealing into a grey blah. This stuff lasts a good while with moderate stinging sillage, but unless you're into an even more extreme form of what Calvin Klein does, this won't be for you. I'd keep Elevator Music to spring and fall casual use if outdoors, and as a work scent if taken inside, because there isn't enough personality here for much more than that.\n\r\nEasily unisex because it's just so painfully nondescript, Elevator Music feels like the smell of an active Macy's fragrance counter, where everything has been tested and is in the air, which is a vibe some people genuinely like, but not me. I don't find the scent of Elevator Music particularly offensive, much like how I feel about the real thing, but it's just a tolerable minor nuisance that I'd feel confused about actually paying for. Perfumer Ben Gorham really hit the nail on the head 100% with the aptly-named Elevator Music, a limited Byredo scent that is \"so Byredo\" it's almost painful, and most certainly not for someone getting their feet wet with the brand. Your thoughts may differ. Neutral for being interesting to experience but otherwise not enjoyable.",

Parfum addresses the two concerns by being a smoother, richer (and somewhat 'dense') variation of the same idea. The grapefruit-geranium is polished, sleek, followed by a woody dry down that's subtly sweet. One good thing: very restrained sweetness, even more so on (my) skin than on paper. However, it's too meek, too quiet, and I wonder what is the point? I would have loved an expansive version of this that would form a bubble of Bleu. Duration is very much middle of the road.

The aquatic tones are much more subtle and work in service of everything else. One-to-two squirts will do you at most, and it lasts quite a while, as you might expect from a Parfum.

			"content": "What does a house like Chanel do when their biggest-selling male fragrance line since probably the first continues to sell well nearly a dacade after it's launch and without the aid of a myriad flanking varieties? Like it or not, the final mainstream masculine work of Jacques Polge, his commercial \"aquatic done right\" which finally placed Chanel into a category it was more than twenty years behind on, was a smash success, and Chanel was smart about not fixing what \"ain't broke\" and handling the line like a feminine one, with alternate formula tweaks via concentration levels rather than entirely new flavors wearing the Bleu de Chanel (2010) badge a la their Allure Homme (1999) line. The latter frankly needed the variety to survive after the Y2K mediocrity that was the original pillar, but such isn't the case here. Jacques Polge took one final stab a year before retirement making an eau de parfum version of Bleu de Chanel simply called Bleu de Chanel Eau de Parfum (2014), and it was a slightly warmer, sweeter, more ambery take on the original that supplemented heavier doses of the ambroxan and norlimbanol the original contained with additional citruses and an old-fashioned vanillic composite amber note. I personally didn't see that one as an essential purchase for owners of the more complex and dynamic eau de toilette, but folks who hadn't yet entered the BdC game might dig it. Jacques Polge was tired, and ready to hand the reigns over to his son Olivier Polge, who had trained under both his father and Chanel artistic director Christopher Sheldrake, so it wasn't much of stretch to imagine that he didn't really try much with the eau de parfum before turning in his keys. Bleu de Chanel Parfum (2018) answers the question first posed at the beginning of this review, and is the first official masculine outing from new head perfumer and prodigal son Olivier Polge. I feel like Bleu de Chanel Parfum is a direct reaction to competitors like Dior Sauvage (2015) and Yves Saint Laurent Y for Men (2017), as both of them continued upping the ante with ambroxan and norlimbanol in a \"loudness war\" for the title of screechiest chemical fragrance of the century (and I like Sauvage so I say that kindly). Bleu de Chanel Parfum keeps itself distinguished by moving not up, but to the side, offering a fundamentally different experience from the core pillar of the Bleu de Chanel line, unlike the erstwhile EdP.\n\r\nBleu de Chanel Parfum sees Olivier Polge strip away a lot of the rather impressive blending his father did with the original Bleu de Chanel note structure, and indeed hacks away at unessential notes too, with a lot of the citrus outside the grapefruit gone with the wind. In their place, Olivier introduces a rounded French lavender, giving a link of sorts to the fresh foug\u00e8re genre of the early 90's citing examples like Eternity for Men by Calvin Klein (1989) or Paco Rabanne XS Pour Homme (1993). Pink peppercorn surives the cull, while the dihydromyrcenol and mint are kicked up, giving the parfum a stronger \"dryer sheet\" aquatic lean not unlike Wings for Men by Giorgio Beverly Hills (1994), but these notes rush into the heart very quickly and all but the mint drops off. There, in that glorious middle, cedar joins this mint, alongside labadanum and ginger, with the rest of the old heart also excised from the composition. The base of Bleu de Chanel parfum is where the most dramatic difference lies between it and it's fore-bearers, since the ambroxan is turned up but the norlimbanol turned down, and some form of Australian sandalwood (New Caledonian according to Chanel) taking the place of the trimmed \"karmawood\" scratch. The composite amber note from the eau de parfum is also here, but it is turned down and therefore less vanillic or sweet, serving just to round off the additional woods, the lingering mint, ginger, and soft citrus. The result of this stark simplification is a version of Bleu de Chanel which feels more natural, with much more note separation, and clear-cut transitions from the top, heart, and base through the wear. Now I'm not saying there still isn't a prescription's worth of synthetics in the parfum, but they share space with more natural-smelling, if not actually natural accords here, with minimal traces of the \"scouring powder\" scratch that many things from the genre the original Bleu de Chanel created seem to break down into in the end. Just like the advertisements say, this is a woody, more aromatic, and intense interpretation of Bleu de Chanel.\n\r\nWhereas I felt the eau de parfum was a sweeter, richer, and quieter take on the eau de toilette made void of it's freshness (and charm), the parfum isn't similarly an aquatic with it's wings clipped, but rather not really an aquatic at all thanks to the prominent lavender. What we have here is a woodsy parfum with a minty lavender citrus barbershop top, using aquatic elements blended into mint and lavender to make the appropriate \"bleu\" vibe, but without actually feeling like it's replicating the smell of water. Bleu de Chanel parfum has a similar approach to what Aqua Velva (1935) or Gillette Cool Wave (1993) take by placing an aqueous note back behind lavender and mint and not the other way around. Without sounding like I'm debasing the Chanel by comparing it to a drugstore aftershave, let's just say that it's an ephemeral freshness meant to introduce and not dominate the rest of the composition. Once Bleu de Chanel Parfum gets on skin for any appreciable amount of time, it's minty woods, lavender, and amber for the duration, which is a far cry from the original EdT or even EdP, meaning owning the parfum would not be redundant for owners of the EdT, unlike the EdP release. Wear time for Bleu de Chanel Parfum is long and sillage is actually greater than with the Eau de Parfum release, and since it jives differently, one could almost layer the original eau de toilette on top the parfum so as to get that dynamic citrus and pepper on top the lavender, amber, and sandalwood base. People who took issue with the synthetic nature of the original entry, or just hate all things modern will not click with this, and if the original Bleu de Chanel couldn't change your mind about aquatics, this parfum won't change your mind about the Bleu de Chanel line either. The parfum feels like a companion fragrance that's nearly a flanker with the way it stands apart, which is something Dior and YSL also seem to be doing with higher concentrations of their marquee masculines as well. Bleu de Chanel sees Olivier Polge hitting the ground running, and the simple elegant quality here has me hoping that the next great masculine pillar will be a real return to form for the house of Chanel.

The bottle was fancy, and the name enticed me forth to explore something special.\n\r\nTropical Cherimoya Cologne by Jo Malone has some exotic ingredients I had to research:\n\r\n* Cherimoya - a South American, edible fruit-bearing plant tasting of bananas, coconut, strawberries, mangoes, papaya, and pineapple\r\n* Copahu (copaiba) - bitter, pungent, balsamic resin taken from the Copahu balm tree in South America\r\n* Passion flower - tendril-bearing vines, shrubs or trees found primarily in Mexico, Central and South America, bearing colorful, showy flowers which have been used for tea and have a sweet, floral fruity scent\n\r\nThis cologne has a strong South American vibe to it, that's for sure!\n\r\nNow, as for actual perception / performance...TCC isn't quite as exotic as I'd hoped. :-( \n\r\nThe fancy ingredients don't seem stick out much nor last very long to be truly enjoyed and appreciated. (The sweet, fruity Cherimoya is almost non-existent.) There is a slight tropical flair to this one, but it smells more generic than revolutionary, as I hoped it would with the above three notes.\n\r\nThis one ends up being more of a slightly fancy white floral feminine scent with tonka standing out with more durability and a disappointing, overly familiar counterpoint to the triumvirate of fancy South American notes I was wanting so much to enjoy.\n\r\nMeh. :-/\n\n",

			"content": "I bought this recently and it came during the last Spring snowstorm in Chicago... which given how it smells is entirely appropriate.\n\r\nSuch an interesting and different scent than the Encre Noir and Lalique Homme / Homme Voyager that I love to wear.\n\r\nIt starts out minty with these whisps of tobacco, but on me the mint fades FAST.  Like maybe ten minutes into it it is gone.  Then the fig leaf and tobacco takes over and it is like gliding into the warmest, coziest leather smoking lounge ever. Unlike the other Lalique men's fragrances, it really winds its way through you and wraps you in some other world.  I don't know how to put it better than that. There are complicated things going on with Voyager, but this doesn't challenge you to figure out what is going on - it just IS.  \n\r\nI was literally walking around smiling and saying \"oh wow\" as it worked its chemistry on my skin through the afternoon.  \n\r\nI get no bergamot from this, which I thought was strange as I can pick up on it fast in a scent.  But everything else registers to me like playing a chord one note at a time and then all together.  \n\r\nI think this is going to be a real keeper.  The only strange thing I notice, and I don't yet have the vocabulary to express it in scent, is that I get undertones of vintage Shalimar for women here.  I mean, it doesn't smell like Shalimar, but there is something here that definitely whispers it to me.  \n\r\nI am almost happier with this than I was with my first bottle of Encre Noir.  Almost.  They are totally different, but I think this is going to be in heavy rotation - especially in weather that demands more clothing.  I can totally imagine the smile as I put on a jacket in which this lingers in the fibers.  Great sillage so far without occupying ALL THE SPACE like Voyager Homme and White do. ",

			"content": "Avon Premiere Luxe is a line of scents for both men and women targeted towards niche tastes, using higher-than-usual concentrations for Avon (in this case being a men's parfum), and ingredients of higher concentration and supposed quality than is the norm for the venerable mass-market direct sales house, which is often considered of drugstore quality. By and large, the line succeeds in it's aim to bring a little more prestige to the Avon name, except not where such things are needed most, like in it's former home market of the US, but rather everywhere else, particularly in developing markets like South America and Eastern Europe. Still, with some hunting, Avon sellers willing to ship internationally do occasionally turn up for those of us who won't take no for an answer, and this one might be worth the stubbornness to acquire. Yves Caesar composed this and it's sequel flanker a year later, and this is definitely the romantic one while the subsequent oud version is more formal. Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme does a lot of things right with it's rich, decadent, but mostly fundamental formula; the scent gives fans of niche perfumery that \"less is more\" feeling they crave, with fairly clear note separation, not a ton of blending to hide synthetic fillers, and nothing applied in shy amounts. Where Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme fails is in originality, which for anyone who knows Avon, is a pretty well-expected shortcoming of anything wearing the Avon badge. Dior, Narciso Rodriquez, Yves Saint Laurent, and Giorgio Armani are all recalled in Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme, which is it's biggest failing, as a product with niche sensibilities but a designer stylistic vibe still might be seen by the target demographic as disingenuous at best or a plebeian mockery of niche principles at worst. I mean really guys, Avon must surely have known anyone serious enough about scents that they'd drop the kind of coin needed to buy Creed or Roja Dove wouldn't even consider Avon to begin with, so this product serves the same purpose as a Hyundai Genesis G90: an aspirational trim-level with a focus on quality-for-dollar alongside style from an otherwise value-conscious brand. If this appeals to you, read on; if not, you should probably stop here.\n\r\nAvon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme feels most like a gourmand in it's opening, even if it really isn't. A lemon note meets with patchouli and ginger here, which is not groundbreaking, but suggests something spicy and culinary before a slight black pepper kicks in after the top calms. The middle of the scent is vetiver and amber pretty much, and that amber comes on strong just like a Tom Ford masculine scent from the early 2000's, since it's not actually in the base where it normally plays the rhythm section rather than being somewhat in the lead. The oud flanker of this that came later would knock the amber out of it's home in the middle to be replaced with agarwood/oud, also cranking up the pepper, which is why it doesn't feel romantic. Rest assured the amber here is not of typical \"beige sweetness\" kind Avon has been stuffing in it's perfume since the 60's, and feels rawer. The base is guiac wood and musk, with little else to get in the way of the mellow and sweet dry down one might expect such a base to provide. The end of the wear sees a bit of Avon's inevitable budgetary limitations come to the fore, which betray any sense of sincerity at producing a true niche fragrance for men that the bottle design and opening whiff might give off. The amber and musk linger longest, with the clean guiac woods poking their head in now and again, making the final stages akin to Armani Code/Black Code (2004), which is the furthest thing from exclusive you could get. Still, the quality is there at least in the performance department, and this will last every bit of 12 hours, needing scrubbing and laundering of clothes to remove. Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme's sweet, inviting warmth and spiky amber combine with clean woods and musk to make it a truly black tie romantic evening scent. Nobody smelling you at a five star restaurant will have any idea that the elixir in this little black bottle is from Avon, let alone not even at least designer in origin. \n\r\nWhere this screams niche most is in it's uncompromisingly rich top ingredients and bold overall blending, as you will stand out quite a bit amongst lesser freshies and club-friendly ambroxen wonder juices, but it doesn't stay that way forever, turning back into a pumpkin of amber, woods and musk by the end. Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme is pretty skippable as an attempt at niche sensibilities for those not devout in their Avon collecting or morbidly curious, especially folks living in markets like the US where it becomes a Maltese falcon to find. This masculine debut of the line did bring a much-needed higher-end option for guys who are into Avon, and one that they had not seen since 1985's F\u00e9raud pour Homme, but Avon Premiere Luxe Oud Pour Homme (2016) flanker hits the mark more accurately as something truly niche in design from these discount catalog sellers, as there is nothing quite like it (and it smells little to nothing like this too, which is surprising). Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme is a damn fine scent, just not entirely what it makes itself out to be, and proves yet again that Avon are the master blasters of the almighty amber. People not fond of a heavy-handed amber should also skip forward to the oud flanker, which is drier and obviously more wood-focused than this one. Recommended use is evening, romantic or leisure activity, and mostly in formal settings where sartorial attire is fitting. Avon Premiere Luxe Pour Homme is too heady and rich for daytime use outside of stiffly cold weather, and feels way too decadent for office or casual applications, plus it's parfum concentration means you might want to go light on the trigger too. A dark, semi-sweet, slightly smoky, and slightly soapy amber fragrance that sits tall alonside the best amber-based designers of the early to mid 2000's, just with a few niche twists stapled on in post-production to suit the 2010's instead. A hell of a bargain considering what you're getting in the bottle, but like that Hyundai Genesis G90, will likely lose all sense of value within a decade or so due to brand perception, so wear this because you like this, not because you're out to impress anybody. This is certainly not your Dad's Avon, that's for sure. ",

			"content": "cK One Gold is amazing for two reasons: It's a flanker that is not a seasonal redressing of cK One (1994), and it actually takes the nameplate in a new direction without the need to make two separate gendered versions a la cK One Shock (2011) and cK One Red (2014), meaning it's both a unique-smelling and still truly unisex flanker in the series for the first time since cK One Scene (2009). Typically this kind of scent is left to the bigger niche houses outside the cK series; just sniff anything Mancera or Bond No. 9 and outside obviously-named creations, you tell me what sex is -supposed- to wear it? It's an area of pure art that designers don't touch because their demographic research won't allow, outside of Calvin Klein's deliberately and ostentaciously unisex cK line (plus all the intial designer imitators of the 90's). Usually my hat's off to the \"Nuveau Niche\" houses (Guerlain and Penhaligon's have been at this forever so they don't count), but in this case, Calvin Klein has proved capable of delivering a unisex scent that has a lot of character for a change, since a lot of the cK seasonal flankers riffed too close to the original for comfort. cK One Gold is the second \"Gold\" flanker to appear in the Calvin Klein catalog outside a set of them for the Euphoria nameplate in 2014, but shares no other commonality. The warm, woodsy, fruity, and sensuous cocktail here was made for fall use but is light enough for summer too; it has only fair sillage but really good longevity and presence. You'll know cK One Gold is there all day but you won't knock anyone down with it. Like all cK One bottles, the atomizer is separate, so be careful if carried to work (or stuff a tube over the neck if atomizer is left in). If you're anything like me, you'll want to carry this delicious number to work more than a few times, it's really that good.\n\r\nFig, bergamot, and a strong sage open up cK One Gold, and it's almost so sweet initially that one might be convinced this is going feminine, but actually things shift towards aromatic as the sage creeps up to dominate and turn this into almost a peach ghost note opening similar to Mario Valentino Ocean Rain (1990) or to a much lesser extent, cK Be (1996). Now before you crucify me for comparing a Calvin Klein scent to a creation by the almighty late Edmond Roudnitska, it's really just the opening, and doesn't have the animal sweat factor he was known for, although it does take a semi-meaty turn with neroli, jasmine, and violet playing with tarragon in the middle, which is how the pedulum swings back to gender-neutral here. By this part, we realize that this stays not only sexually ambiguous but also devoid of the \"Kleinisms\" fantasy notes like most CK creations tend to have; I'm not saying there aren't synthetics or custom captives here, they're just the mortar instead of the bricks, and therefore unlisted. The base is simple enough with patchouli, vetiver, guaiac wood, and what is a \"slightly Sauvagy\" norlimbanol/ambroxen/woody aromatic chemical filler alongside a slight dollop of white musk. It's a far richer experience than any cK series scent since perhaps the original cK One, which itself was only really rich with profuse white musk at the end. I feel cK One Gold is indeed a little rounder and weightier than the landmark original, but ironically less stifling because the musk is dialed down. These now-standard-issue synthetic base fillers don't take over the scent like they can in other creations containing them, but despite the natural pyramid, we're neither dealing with vintage nor niche, so their use is almost expected. It's all fairly well-done and immaculately balanced. I still feel that maybe women will dig this more because of the soft fruity tones, but guys who can ensure them will surely love the dry down phase.\n\r\nSadly the nose is again unpublished, so I don't know who's responsible for this little treat of a scent. I think it's good enough to be an anchor, but Calvin Klein likes wasting those on far more pandering creations they think will fill the coffers based on whatever their latest focus groups tell them, and this is ironically too niche in design for such a risk to be taken; it's just a sign of the times I suppose. Much like cK One Shock for Him or cK One Scene, I see this being bought in the mainstream segments for the bottle graphics (a handsome gold-dipped clear cK One bottle), and praised by perfumistas in the know, while everyone else just ignores it as yet another brand-abusing cK One flanker without ever giving it a try due to their presumptions. My only complaint if any, is this does seem a bit aimed at the club scene, and sniffs slightly of \"what Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008) would smell like if it was a cK One flanker\", but it's only in general feel, since the fragrances don't share any significant notes at all, and cK One Gold is about eight years late to that party. Oh well, at least this one isn't a seasonal run, so it might have more than one batch made, in case I use up this tasty little treat and wish to seek more in the future. Dare I say this flanker almost surpasses the original? Nah, but it is on equal ground and easily my favorite cK One variant to date. Recommended for romance or evening use, but can get you by on a hot day as well, you just might attract more attention than intended if you're at work! This one's solid gold baby!! ",

			"content": "Commodity is a fragrance house that likes to name its creations after either single notes, items, colors, or substances. This is a quirk they no doubt have in common with niche operations like Le Labo, but unlike the latter, they don't really bank on the science gimmick with packaging and presentation which resembles test samples from a laboratory. The kind of super-minimalist perfume in both packaging and olfactory theme Commodity employs clearly has an audience, as Commodity has been doing well since their formation in 2013 by entrepreneurs Konstantin Glasmacher and Ash Huzenlaub through a Kickstarter campaign. Now distributed brick and mortar through LVMH or online by their own eCommerce operation, Commodity try to make boring seem interesting, and how the fragrance community which mostly consumes these kind of high-concept niche goodies perceives this goal has been mixed to say the least. Orris (2017) is themed after the tuber itself, but soapiness usually associated with orris root is actually quite restrained here, since this is built up quite differently than one might expect a fragrance sporting orris as its main note. Commodity in general doesn't seem to get a whole lot of talk outside your local Sephora sales reps, who always try to push the stuff because it is an exclusive brand in their stores, and I can sort of see why. The enforced drab aesthetic of the grand might appeal to hipsters looking to be as intentionally misunderstood and unapproachable as possible, but anyone with a more balanced outlook will shake their head at a brand that deliberately reduces themselves to a \"commodity\".\n\r\nCommodity Orris comes out the gate quietly when sprayed, and presents itself as a very dry, citric and sharp scent thanks to bergamot, coriander, and pink peppercorn. One might almost mistake this for Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (2009), until one realizes that the vetiver is but a distant recollection here compared to the Tom Ford fragrance, making Orris feel more like a niche precursor to Dolce & Gabbana The One Grey (2018), which I was not too fond of myself.  Commodity makes mention of carrot seed being in this, but God only knows what that smells like in this greyed-out opening, so I'm going to assume it's there. The middle of cedar and dry patchouli is quite clear after the citrus and dry spy settle down, with wisps of the orris already starting to appear. There is something a black tea note here which reminds me of Bvlgari Black (1998) without the rubbery aspects, but it is pretty brief and flanked by some nondescript white florals that act as connective tissues to the orris in the base. vanilla and vetiver act as both angel and devil on the shoulder for the orris base, since one smooths and sweetens Commodity Orris into something approachable, while the other keeps the overall feel very erudite and stoic, like a perfume made for a librarian or wise sage from times lost to history. Combined, the effect is a bit ambiguous and depending on the way the air catches Orris, you might get the amiable side, or the standoffish side, with a straight face either way. Wear time is mediocre as is sillage, which is the one big let down for Commodity scents in general, but with Orris being relatively stiff and business-like anyway, it might make the perfect in-the-background work fragrance for any gender.\n\r\nOrris is part of the Platinum Collection, which consists entirely of commonly-used top or base notes in traditional perfume, whilst other series focus on mood or impressions of things instead of going for soliflore-like interpretations. Commodity encourages their scents being \"wardrobed\" by customers, which is their fancy way of saying layered with each other, so perhaps Orris might go well with something that has a bit more pep in its step from within the Commodity lines or elsewhere. On it's own, Orris isn't really the greatest example of a scent built around the note, not that many are in the first place since Orris never got the kind of oakmoss did before restriction (which got its own homage scent from Commodity in 2013), nor popularity of something like oud or amber, neither of which have any shortage of perfumes themed after them. Semi-clean, semi-dry, and relatively simple in development despite its many ingredients, Commodity Orris won't impress, and as the olfactive equivalent of MTV's Daria, it's no wonder that nobody really talks about it. Still, I do like orris as it is often featured in aromatic foug\u00e8res and traditional colognes, so I can't find fault per se in Orris but neither do I find any favor, since Commodity has proved with their execution that orris root is not really interesting enough on its own to have a scent built around it like sandalwood or even lavender. This is an easy neutral for me, and since neutral tones are what the brand seems to be all about, it's an appropriate reaction. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take a nap.  ",

			"content": "I tried the EdP of Azzaro Wanted by Night ( the EdT has brass colored 'bullets' in the bottle).\n\r\nThe opening is not nice. It's too much and it's quite synthetic. A sweet anise, some hints of tropical fruit (mango? tuttifrutti?) and some citrus. As said, they are not very natural fruit notes but the tropical ones are the most natural. At this stage it's sweet and sour, however, the way the sourness comes across is as if it was definitely intended to be sweet but kind of ended up smelling 'off' in a way. \n\r\nIt gets better though. And I think they traded off scoring with the opening for longevity of the fruit notes, which is very good.\n\r\nThe drydown is cinnamon, red cedarwood, ambery sweetness. In the background (and when rubbing) there are still tropical fruit notes present which is remarkable. Good projection and longevity I have to say. Sillage too probably. \n\r\nAll in all I have personally smelled similar note combinations in certain room perfumes (apart from the fruitiness), so this EdP reminds me of those so I cannot position it as a success/positive, even if I don't actually find it that bad, but because it's coming from Azzaro the lack of creativity in that part is not acceptable to me. This might not be the case for others! It's not the manliest in the drydown either, must be said. \n\r\nA bit of (blonde) tobacco would have helped it a lot imo. I now see that Tobacco is actually listed but I don't get any of it. That said, with more tobacco, it might have gone towards a V&R Spicebomb clone.\n\n",

			"content": "If Azzaro Wanted (2016) never really had much chance with the fragrance community, then Azzaro Wanted By Night (2018) likely has even less, since it's another \"faux ambergis\" build with the heavily-abused ambroxan base aromachemical, but jacked up to parfum strength. Other parfum counterparts of popular masculine fragrances embroiled in the \"ambroxan Loudness War\" usually mix some brisk aromatics or dry woods into the base to keep the sweetness equal to the standard eau de toilette entry, but with beefed-up resonance, which is how Chanel approached Bleu de Chanel Parfum (2018), and Dior handled Sauvage Eau de Parfum (2018). Azzaro Wanted By Night plays equal parts flanker and \"parfum edition\" of the original Azzaro Wanted, upping the concentration of the scent and also to adding to the note pyramid without much counter-balancing of the sweetness such amplification entails, creating a club-friendly rendition of Azzaro Wanted that explains the title. For Mr. Joe Blow of Averageville, this is probably a good thing, as he can now take his favorite daily driver for a night cruise to the local watering hole for overpriced drinks and phone numbers passed on napkins, but for the \"discerning fragrance connoisseur\" that doesn't buy anything without a minimum of 3 accents over the vowels in the title anymore, this one is guilty of high treason for taking the house of Azzaro even further down the dark path of the \"basic broseph dude\". All cultural division parody aside, Azzaro Wanted by Night does seem to cash in shamelessly on the style of Versace Eros (2013), YSL La Nuit L'Homme (2009), and Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008), but it makes sense, as the perfumer behind the latter is also responsible for this creation, even if he's not alone. \n\r\nMichel Girard joins with Quentin Bisch, who previously developed limited \"modern update\" editions of both Azzaro Pour Homme (1978) and Azzaro Chrome (1996) in 2016, with the pair tackling Fabrice Pellegrin's original work in Azzaro Wanted by adding in cinnamon, tobacco, lavender, and cedar to the primary accords, plus tweaking some knobs to reach the desired effect. Sweet French lavender joins the ginger and lemon of the original's top, which sufficiently dulls the \"freshness\" of it and makes it more compatible with night air. From there, we get the same transition into cardamom and cade oil, with the juniper note that produces turned up higher and flanked with cinnamon and tobacco, delivering a rich, spicy, intoxicating effect only a few minutes into the wear that greatly appeals to fans of assertive club scents, but admittedly few else. The base comes rather quickly and congeals with the heart to produce a linear effect that lasts the rest of the wear, replacing the vetiver of the original base with cedar, but doubling down on tonka and ambroxan. There's so much ambroxan here, that Wanted by Night might as well be the reference scent for it, as once the cinammon and lavender finally fall by the wayside, the ambroxan sweetness just throbs and throbs on skin until washed off. Sillage is intense, and longevity is near-immortal, which ironically makes this take on the Azzaro Wanted scent profile more suited performance-wise for day wear, even if stylistically, it's a nightmare of alpha male aggression. A little goes a long way doesn't begin to describe this stuff's power.\n\r\nI can't bring myself to hate Azzaro Wanted by Night, as I find the original a really nice semi-oriental take on the ambroxan trend, with some old-school thinking applied to an ostensibly new-age kind of genre. Once all the faux-ambergris and norlimbanol scents finally fall out of fashion the way 90's calone and hedione freshies eventually did, this may very well be considered the Joop Homme (1989) of it's generation in terms of sheer \"come here baby\" loudness and swagger, even if it's not pulling up to the club in a lowered Subaru Impreza WRX with running lights like the rest of its ilk. Bottom line, Azzaro Wanted by Night smells like it is made to be lightly layered on top of the original Azzaro Wanted and \"take over\" for the business casual feel of the original, adding sexy spice and amped sweetness on top of the skin scent left behind by the original, so if worn that way, I give this a thumbs up, as it's literally like an accessory to the original for club or party use. As a scent on it's own, I couldn't see owning this, even if I had the original, as like with other \"distinguished fragrance connoisseurs\" I poked fun at above, I am too busy playing with smelly juices to be bothered with my local club scene, and am instead sitting here writing these reviews for you. For a club-worthy flavor enhancer to the original Wanted, or just a heady sweet party juice for an all-night bender, this is a good addition to your wardrobe, but for everyone else, there really is nothing to see here, but you probably guessed as much by the name alone. I highly recommend sniffing the original Azzaro Wanted before going anywhere near this, as they are literally night and day, pun fully and unapologetically intended.

The combined effect does strongly remind me of Nutella! Not only is there the obvious creamy milky chocolate taste, but also the deliciously nutty yet rich and oily flavour of hazelnut. \n\r\nThis Nutella phase generally starts to fade within 20 minutes. The fragrance first turns into a standard boozy plum amber during 3 hours, with occasional teases of faint peppery spiciness as well as a mineral nuance I associate with ambroxan. It then becomes a comforting, milky vanilla skin scent for the remainder of the fragrance. The resinous, slighty spicy labdanum, along with the woody, leathery, rum-like and tobacco tonalities of vanilla, grows slightly stronger towards the end. But overall they're still quite faint, and the fragrance maintains its tender and cozy nature.\n\r\nThe sillage is moderate at first, and quickly remains close to skin, although the longevity can easily reach 10 hours.\n\r\nAccording to the accompanying booklet, Fanny Bal intends to update historical amber bases such as Ambre 83 to modern taste by attempting a gourmand interpretation, which I find overall successful. The vivid Nutella opening act is very impressive, with flavour and texture and all, and the later stage indeed feels coherent to the modern taste preferring a more streamlined style, although not without subtle intrigues. Even though it's intended as a base and can feel a bit simplistic as a fragrance, I would not be surprised if it becomes popular among gourmand fans with the right marketing strategy.",

			"content": "This modern interpretation of Epic\u00e8ne Gamma base smells refreshingly green and herbal, with the leafy greenery of geranium, powdery verdency of lentisque and the grassy bitterness of clary sage evoking \"white tea\" to my nose. There is also a steamy clarity upon these vegetal notes that makes me think of \"green pea\". Occasional surges of peppery sparkles among the verdant elements also bring to mind \"green bell pepper\" as well.\n\r\nHowever, the fragrance is still rather abstract as a whole, despite the aformentioned evocations. With the underlying sour, citrusy woods, it indeed has a retro vibe like those 70's/80's fresh masculine colognes, but illuminated by modern radiance and transparency.\n\r\nThe fragrance gradually loses its opening green freshness with time, but generally maintains the same olfactory profile throughout. The sillage is more or less close to skin and it lasts at least 8 hours.\n\r\nConsidering it as an updated version of a base created during the 70's, I find it quite successful in appealing to modern sensibilities without completely shaking off its classic heritage. Its nuanced green aspect is also closer to what I had imagined prior to sampling Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Amazingreen. However, one caveat I have is that I hardly detect any leathery facet described in the accompanying booklet. \n\n",

When something tannin-like and smoky comes through and aligns with the fermented vegetation note, I'm reminded of fermented tea leaves and milk tea as a whole. When a powdery texture and the invigorating spiciness of cardamom make an appearance, the fragrance vaguely recalls rice desserts from South East Asian cuisine to me. \n\r\nUnfortunately, the creamy milkiness and that sour vegetal note seem too forceful to share any spotlight with other nuances, and largely overshadow them, which results to a rather stagnant \"sour mandarine sitting in stale milk for too long impression\" to me. Moreover, with its heavy to moderate sillage and a rather excellent longevity (still easily detectable after 10 hours), it quickly becomes tiring to my nose.\n\r\nIn principle, I quite like this kind of juxtaposition between milky elements and something vegetal/smoky/bitter/spicy to cut through it. While this aesthetics is often employed in chai or South East Asian dessert-themed perfumes, I hadn't yet encountered this simultaneously repulsive yet intriguing fermented vegetation aspect incorporated by Dadier. Personally, I'd hope this composition would tone down a bit its creamy milkiness to let other nuances bring in more dynamics, but as it is, I can imagine it being put out by a niche brand with an \"unconventional\" or \"rebellious\" identity.

The color here is a radioactive yellow. This waxy-candy-overload impression is so strong I can't pick up much else for at least 15-20 minutes. I'm just about ready to scrub and pray for relief when a faint light starts emerging at the end of the tunnel, so I stick it out: \n\r\nSomething oddly clean, medicinal, and mineralic is growing, and I think there's something sweetly floral going on here, like Immortelle. This is one hell of an odd scent when these two personalities are at war in the heart.\n\r\nAfter another 30 minutes or so, the clean personality has won out, and there's a faintly antiseptic vibe, but also sweet and bubblegummy. The color is now purple-ish green, and there's an icy-cool metallic streak running through it. There's a trace of modern designer familiarity in there, but this still mostly a surreal experience. If you've ever swished that harsh-sweet-antiseptic fluoride stuff at the dentist, it's like they somehow carved out the unpleasant parts of that and made the rest into a palatable smell.

			"content": "When Loc Dong stated in the booklet about the overdose of dihydromyrcenol, he's not joking. While there are whiffs of creamy tuberose from afar, the opening of this \"seven sins of perfumery\" when sniffed up close, is actually a massive assault of this molecule to my nose, reminiscent of metallic lemon and lavender, and inevitably reminding me of those unpleasant times when someone walked into a metro or an elevator with a cloud of masculine sports cologne, thus a cloud of dihydromyrcenol.\n\r\nThankfully, the mentholated greenness of tuberose and the bitter verdency of galbanum burst into the scene soon enough. This combination slightly reminds me of the same pairing in Naomi Goodsir Nuit de Bak\u00e9lite, but the general impression is completely different due to the significant presence of dihydromyrcenol. While these additional green facets help me to disassociate the overall scent from \"mass-market men's cologne\" connotation, the metallic and mineral aspects of dihydromyrcenol turns these green leaves into inorganic sharp blades.\n\r\nThese green aspects retreat to the sidelines after about 1 hour, and the remainder of the fragrance becomes essentially a dual between this sharp metallic note, and the slightly meaty but mostly suave and creamy tuberose. As I love tuberose but hate prominent metallic dihydromyrcenol, smelling this fragrance is like going through many jump-scares throughout the day: just when I thought, oh what a lovely tuberose, I got a savage bite from these metallic teeth.\n\r\nAs for the maltol and Cosmofruit mentioned in the booklet, I don't particularly detect the caramel/cotton candy aspect of the former, or the quince and tatin tarte characteristics of the later as individual notes, but the tuberose does have a subtle candied and peachy/fruity undertone that might stem from them. And it more candied, musky, even slightly leathery with time, although the overall floral tonality is still dominant. While the metallic facet does mellow with time, it still remains at the horizon, like a curse that will never go away.\n\r\nIts sillage is strong to moderate, and it easily lasts more than 10 hours.\n\r\nI love the pairing of creamy, voluptuous tuberose with fierce green elements in general for the intriguing contrast of texture and scent, and combining them with sharp metallic notes also seem an interesting idea at least on paper. In this \"seven sins\", I couldn't really get past my hatred towards dihydromyrcenol, but it can surely be marketed as a provocative perfume from an avant-garde niche house, and I'm definitely interested in smelling a version with a different type of metallic notes.",

A silky floral heart of rose and ylang ylang is the central pairing to my nose, hightlighting the former's honeyed suavity and tart wine-like aftertaste, as well as the later's banana peel-like duality of green astringency and sweet creaminess. The sparkles of aldehyde provide a refreshing lift to the flowers, while a subtle puff of iris powder lend a certain sophistication. \n\r\nThe peppers being more woody and less fiery than clove, create a cooler, sleeker personality than the warmer, more enveloping traditional carnation, and indeed more modern. But I also occasionally detect a discreet mossy woody undertone reminiscent of a very faint isobutylquinoline that pulls me back to a more classic setting, although I don't know if it's actually used or an olfactory illusion of powder, rose's greenness and other woody elements.\n\r\nAmong the 14 entries of 2017's Speed Smelling, Dumur's \"modern carnation\" is one of my favourites, and one that I'm most inclined to purchase as it is. On the surface, it's pretty straightforward as a composition, but the different facets of floral rotate and glitter with time, contributing to its natural sensation while still maintaining a clarity and accomdating to modern taste, which I find quite successful. Here's hoping that it will be released as a fragrance itself or as a main accord of a fragrance one day.\n\n",

Apparently, carnation isn't (can't be?) naturally extracted so it is instead typically represented in perfumes by combining rose with eugenol. I ran into this issue recently when I sampled Vetiverus from Oliver & Co, and I couldn't for the life of me understand why it had such a potent herbal note to it that I identified as cloves. Cloves were not listed as a note but with a little further research I found that eugenol can present as cloves. So for anyone whose nose is more sensitive to eugenol, the two elements won't combine properly to produce carnation. That made it particularly impressive that Dumur produced such a believable carnation here. She put together a cocktail of floral elements and spices to produce what to my nose was a wholly accurate carnation scent. It was like having a corsage of carnation on my wrist. Not that I\u2019ve ever had a corsage of carnation on my wrist. Well, now it's like I have had a corsage of carnation on my wrist so I can't say that any longer.

When combined with the sweet milkiness, it reminds me of how the milky and metallic facets in Etat Libre d'Orange Secr\u00e9tion Magnifique are paired with marine saltiness of seaweed to create this repulsive-yet-intriguing effect. Here it's of course not as remotely disturbing as Secr\u00e9tion Magnifique, but it does impart a certain metallic animalic darkness. \n\r\nAlthough overall the fragrance remains more or less linear, it grows warmer and slightly more ambery with time, and sometimes gives out an abstract leathery dried fruit undertone as well.

What I find interesting, besides the enticing contrast between comforting milkiness and menacing mossy woods, is that it maintains the 70s retro vibe, but at the same time seems apt to go into a more futuristic setting as well, thanks to its metallic undertone.

			"content": "This Jean-Christophe H\u00e9rault creation opens with a seamless blend of bitter liqueur, hints of preserved cherry, a tannic woody undertone and bright orange flavour that creates a very convincing Grand Marnier accord, along with a delicious whiff of cacao powder.\n\r\nThe fragrance mostly maintains this boozy accord throughout. While it loses the cacao note after about 30 minutes, a soft vanilla creaminess creeps up around the boozy accord and evokes a pina colada/preserved stone fruits impression to me, depending on the proportions of creamy, boozy and fruity elements. \n\r\nThe patchouli backbone becomes more discernable after 3 or 4 hours, and the fragrance also turns a tiny bit more ambery with time, although the pina colada impression more or less remains. I also occasionally get allusions of honeyed fruity rose as well. The sillage is moderate to soft, while the longevity is at least 7 hours.\n\r\nI don't often enjoy boozy fragrances, because their booziness are usually very overpowering, likely boosted by woody amber aromachemicals to satisfy the obsession of strong sillage/extreme longevity. Combined with the often lack of nuance, the result can be very tiring to me. But here, the facetted, tender creation of H\u00e9rault avoided the major pitfalls, which turns it into a very enjoyable boozy scent. I'd love to smell it integrated into a complete formula one day, provided it's not reworked into a brutal sillage monster.\n",

			"content": "Bruno Jovanovic aims to recreate the memory of a woman spraying perfumes on fur collar, a glamourous image of the past. And in the accompanying card, he explained how he created the deer musk effect with today's synthetic materials in great detail, but puzzlingly, he left out the most significant player of this composition: a meaty, jammy plum-like, winey and slightly minty and medicinal patchouli-rose.\n\r\nThe fragrance opens with a manure-like note not dissimlar to the animalic oud accord in Nishane Afrika Olifant, but here it's much more streamlined and trimmed of much of the acrid smoke and animalic warmth, to the point that it feels somewhat sterile even though it clearly alludes to something animalic. The aforementioned patchouli-rose accord also immediately kickes in, and swiftly relegates this docile animalic note into a footnote.\n\r\nThe clean powdery white musk effect does become slightly more perceptible with time, which makes this fragrance in my mind like 80% jammy purple patchouli-rose + 20% clean white musk-patchouli-rose \u00e0 la Margiela Lazy Sunday Morning and Narciso Rodriguez for Her EDP. A briny effect can also be perceived at the periphery at one point, but it crashes into the mighty patchouli-rose rock in no time. \n\r\nThe fragrance then keeps this monotonous pounding drumbeats of jammy yet medicinal patchouli-rose for hours and hours, with the only saving grace in the late dry down after 10 hours, when the musk finally integrates into the rose, creating a musky, honeyed rose effect. More sensual than the previous phases, but still comes off quite rigid and robotic compared to other musk fragrances.\n\r\nThe sillage of this fragrance is quite powerful, and the longevity almost over 12 hours, only amplifies its tiresome nature. \n\r\nOut of the 14 compositions, Jovanovic's composition is among the most disappointing to me. Because most of the accompanying cards actually describe their matching fragrance very well, Jovanovic's omission of rose (he apparently did use rose according to a post of blogger greekgoddess) and emphasis on musk created a strongly disconnected experience to me. Even though later on I came to view it as primarily a patchouli-rose fragrance with certain musk facets, I find the patchouli-rose here pretty routine as the type featured in modern \"majestic\" rose fragrances, thus not very inspiring. And the musk accord doesn't seem to integrate with the patchouli-rose matrix, either, and sadly almost get completely crushed by it until late dry down. In the end, it's not as sensual as those rose-musk with real musk, not as edgy as Imaginary Author Bull's Blood, and can't really distinguish itself from the myriad of patchouli-rose, either.",

			"content": "Juliette Karagueuzoglou puts a gourmand spin to the offering to gods - incense, and the opening is indeed a mouthwatering dark chocolate composed from bitter cacao powder and a creamy coconut undertone.\n\r\nThen the incense gradually rises to the surface. The accompanying card describes the employed ingredient - olibanum heart, as \"cleared of its antique dust\", which I find very close to how I experience the incense note here. It imparts a cool, otherwordly sensation, even minty at times, without any dusty, earthly evocation. \n\r\nSo far, I quite enjoy these two major components. However, a third player proves to be unpleasant to my nose: an aridly dry sensation imparted from a certain woody amber aromachemical, Amber Xtreme according to the card. Granted, it's relatively under control compared to many smoky oud or boozy amber fragrances, but it hangs above like the sword of Damocles, threatening to crack the gourmand altar at any time. I guess that this type of dry smoky sensation is probably more modern than the natural dustiness of olibanum, but as these woody amber aromachemicals are more widely used now, they also become somewhat d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and I kind wish an \"ancient\" dustiness for a change.\n\r\nAs the initial chocolate note fades with time, the fragrance becomes slightly more ambery with a subtle leathery dried fruit and creamy musky undertone, but it maintains the overall cool incense effect until the end. The sillage is quite soft, while the longevity is along 9 hours.\n\r\nKaragueuzoglou's chocolate incense kind of reminds me of Fanny Bal's Nutella amber and Nelly Hachem-Ruiz's Mother Milk patchouli, because all three are a tried-and-true gourmand variation on a classic accord, especially in the indie perfumery territory. They benefit from classic training and more refined materials to appear more smooth and more composed, but also may lose the rugged artisan charm depending on one's taste. I still think this fragrance has potential and would love to see it further reworked or incorporated as a partial accord, as long as the woody amber aromachemicals are well harnessed.",

An exercise that is in the same vein as Bruno Jovanovic and Sophie Labb\u00e9, playing olfactory tricks as it's the essence of perfumery. The result does smell like tobacco with a bit musk, but sadly not in a pleasant way to my nose.\n\r\nThe fragrance is dominated by tobacco right from the start. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of lively tobacco leaves like in Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, but weirdly pungent, plastic and metallic, reminiscent of cold cigarette ash and saccahrine preserved cherry with a hint of cinnamon spice. \n\r\nThis \"cold cherry tobacco ash\" effect is stubbornly persistent, and only gets significantly softened after 6 hours. The fragrance eventually becomes more creamy thanks to vanilla and white musk, but that heavy layer of cherry tobacco ash is still there until the end, only letting a tiny bit of artifical civet's manure-like tonality peek through very rarely. The sillage is overall heavy to moderate with a 10-hour longevity on my skin.\n\r\nI don't know if this unpleasant sweet plastic and metallic effect is because of the limitation of materials, or if it needs an evaluator to provide a bit of artistic guide, but as it is, I don't particularly find it beautiful or compelling, despite its technical specialties.\n\n",

Not the enthralling aldehydic opening of myrrh though, but a strangely shrieky metallic one that's probably intended to represent flintstone/gunpowder as explained on the accompanying card. There's even a lavender undertone unpleasently reminiscent of dihydromyrcenol. \n\r\nThankfully, this metallic note doesn't persist too long. The musty, resinous, simultaneously dry and balmy myrrh soon takes the center stage after about half an hour. It's at first partnered with a meaty smoky note slightly similar to that in Le Labo Patchouli 24 for another 30 minutes, then switches to licorice and boozy amber, resulting to a spicy dried plum effect. \n\r\nOnce the boozy/spicy plum note calms down after another 2 hours, the myrrh really starts to shine. Its medicinal coolness, and resinous, leathery, honeyed dried fruit-like tonalities act in unison to create a very soothing skin scent. Its subtle bready texture also reminds me of Mendittorosa Osang, in which this bread-like aspect is amplified tenfold. \n\r\nFrom then on, this fragrance remains almost a myrrh solinote. When the nuances become more muffled with time, unfortunately it comes through like a sort of sugary water with a tiny hint of patchouli. Moreover, the metallic lavender effect still reers its ugly head from time to time. Even it's nowhere near the level in Loc Dong's creation, I still struggled a bit. The sillage is overall rather soft, but the fragrance can last a good 9 hours. \n\r\nAs myrrh is among one of my favourite notes, this fragrance, featuring various nuances of myrrh, is very easy to enjoy for me. The round, meaty smoky note is also a very nice addition. That being said, I'm still slightly disappointed because of the choice of dihydromyrcenol-like metallic note instead of other possibilites. The relative tameness of the smokiness is also a bit frustrating, especially considering that Rasquinet is behind the two remarkable smoky fragrances from Naomi Goodsir. But I'd definitely love to see it further improved in the future.",

I'm not sure what the base smells like, really. Something like a sweet modern woody laundry musk, metallic and remote. I don't love it. \n\r\nAccording to the card on this one, one of the captives listed is called \"Cosmofruit\" - sounds about right to me! And apparently the spice accord is meant to reflect saffon (ah ha! Magnetism!), cardamom and ginger, but they don't read as anything specific to me. Cosmospice.\n",

The fruit here seems to flirt with stone fruits, but not as milky/plush as peach/apricot, nor is it tart and dark like plum. It has a sort of bright pulpiness of grape, but not necessarily in the realistic sense. As for the herbal aspect, it smells like a melange of Mediterranean aromatic herbs at the outset, but gradually grows dryer and takes on a palpable dried tobacco leaf vibe. What's more puzzling, is that there's even a ripe sourness suggesting tomato to me when combined with the green herbs.\n\r\nUnderneath all these, cold smoke of olibanum and myrrh arises. It initially adds a frosty twang to the overal composition, but when it's filtered more and more through the warm fruits and herbs, they merge together into a powdery honeyed myrrh with leathery, ripe dried fruits, and minty, icy sparkles of incense, to my delight, and I find it more full-bodied than Julien Rasquinet's myrrh fragrance in the same set. \n\r\nThe fragrance doesn't change much afterwards, although I did catch glimpses of leathery oud at one time. Its projection is moderate to soft during its 10-hour wear.\n\r\nWith its sensual honeyed myrrh dry down, this modern Kyphi is one of my favourites in 2017 Speed Smelling set, even though I'm still trying to figure out what I'm smelling in the opening. Moreover, it manages to craft a multi-facetted fragrance in a more expansive, transparent modern style, which I find commendable. I'd love to see it get released in the future.",

This fragrance has a unique tension that shows not only stylistically, as a sort of old / new conflict, and as the usual good / bad thing, but there is even a really weird accord that feels solitary and unitary and whole like chypre - like a musical tone - yet it embodies the conflict.  It was a \"note\" that felt both beautiful and unsettling at the same time - a slightly minor key. In many ways, this is the same beauty as certain real ouds, but by a different route, or changed in some ways, which may be extending the same oud facet to create a focal point with a different feeling.\n\r\nI expect we will see some great fragrance derived from this on shelves - possibly in the luxe niche category, if it's not already out there. IFF never lets a great idea like this go to waste.\n\r\nNot kidding about the dream.  I love this hobby!  I think being in a dreamy state can really open us up to the emotional and symbolic messages in fragrance, particularly with some starter cues from the perfumer (like poem titles, etc.)  Brian C.'s review of the new Slumberhouse scent (6s&7s) was a great example.\n\r\nOk. Maybe time to go back to sleep. LOL.\n\r\nGood night.",

A vanilla milk thickened by a delicate touch of creamy coconut, buttery yet starchy orris, and fluffy, almond-y heliotrope, while a subtle, comforting woody whisper from sandalwood counterbalances the potential greasy sensation. It sometimes even has a wheat-like nuance, reminding me of a bowl of cereal and milk at times.\n\r\nA sharp, woody patchouli forms the backbone of the fragrance, to further undercut possible gourmand excess. And with time, it turns more earthy and medicinal, resulting occasional dried plum impression when combined with iris, fresh fig when the green aspect of patchouli crosses path with coconut-y creaminess and sandalwood, and cacao powder when holding hands with vanilla. \n\r\nWhile these above nuances rotate among themselves, the overall impression of this fragrance remains a duet between creamy vanilla and earthy patchouli throughout its wearing. The sillage is pretty intimate, while the longevity can reach around 10 hours. \n\r\nOverall, I quite enjoy this fragrance, especially its nuanced creamy vanilla milk part, homely, delicious, but without being overpowering like some gourmand milky fragrances can be, which fits the maternal milk inspiration perfectly. However, while I understand that the introduction of patchouli might be a means to counterbalance the gourmand elements, I had anticipated a certain musky, gently animalic element to bring home the human connection of maternal milk. As a result, I find it somehow a missed opportunity, even though it's well made and pretty refined as a modern gourmand fragrance.",

The cantaloupe is the biggest standout note, followed by the suede, then musk, then the floral/powder trio of osmanthus/jasmine/iris and finally sandalwood as something that remains only in the background, it seems.\n\r\nWhile most of the notes suggest a cold-weather fragrance, the creation is decidedly a year-round-pleasant option, with some power but still an overall balance of lightness and heaviness, somewhere distantly between an animalic leather fragrance and a freshie, the floral/leather mix being enhanced, frankly, by the use of the cantaloupe and musk.\n\r\nAt the line's standard pricing of $150 for 50ml, it's a fair price for niche craftmanship and a scent that franky is unlike anything I've smelled. Floral leathers are interesting, and one that I love that comes to is Coach Leatherware No. 1, but that's vastly different from Blond.\n\r\nBlond is yet another creation by Hans that impresses me.  I've been most blown away by Fume so far but frankly trying Blond inspires me to go back and retry his other works still in production--Rosenthal, Amora, and Mown.\n\r\nBlond is certainly worth a try, even for those averse to leather or iris.

But it resolves quickly into a sunburst marriage of a pulpy and tart pineapple with Black Agar, Givaudan\u2019s oud base recreation. Do this pair of polar opposites belong together? On this evidence, yes. They\u2019re that strange couple whom the neighbours may be a bit wary of but who seem quite at ease with each other. The key here is a dominant-submissive relationship \u2013 that pineapple fortified with mouth-puckering citrus is solar, and the shade of the Black Agar recedes accordingly. In this heart phase the perfume\u2019s emphasis  is on a kind of clarity \u2013 the vetiver is brisk and non-earthy, Clearwood (Firmenich\u2019s facsimile of patchouli) is a similarly cleaned up and transparent woody note. As the pineapple is neon-lit in this one, the question one needs to ask is how true is it? In the early stages, very. It\u2019s juicy and yet slightly unripe due to the citric influence. But later on, fruit gum associations become undeniable. Thus far I find Black Agar Sunrise quirky, offbeat, original, but it loses me in the later stages where the fruitiness fades and the expectation of a complex woody base prompted by its name remains unfulfilled. Instead one gets a muddled mix of elements reminiscent of some kind of exotic cough preparation, betraying the hand of the hobbyist perfumer.  ",

			"content": "Alright Mr. Choo, I see you! It appears that after a litany of mediocre retreads parroting 20 years worth of \"safe and clean\" choices, Jimmy Choo decides to join the 2010's \"marine ambergris\" gang by upping the ambroxan ratio to dizzying heights. It's a move just like Dior Sauvage (2015), Versace Dylan Blue (2016), or Y Eau de Parfum (2018), the latter of which launched concurrently to this. However, what those scents do right which this does wrong is pair that ambroxan with something memorable (or shocking) to make a modern \"ambroxan bomb\" that actually stands out on its own merits. Sauvage has that extreme \"desert-like\" demeanor thanks to overcharged ambroxan and norlimbanol with little else to blend them, while Dylan Blue revisits early 2000's fruity notes and the Y eau de Parfum mixes plenty of warmth into it's faux ambergris late in the drydown to make a dynamic switch from cool aquatic top to cozy base. With Jimmy Choo Man Blue (2018), we get a personality closest to Y Eau de Parfum, but midway between it and the abysmal Y by Yves Saint Laurent (2017) eau de toilette version from the previous year. If you know anything about that travesty, you'll know how irredeemably scratchy and itchy it becomes when it tries to fold powdery barbershop elements into it's mix, and the distinct lack of those elements in the EdP version (replaced with oriental notes) are what makes that iteration actually quite good. Jimmy Choo Man Blue kicks its feet by trying to serve up \"half and half\" with some barbershop elements mixed with some oriental ones, and that ambroxan playing traffic control for it all before giving into the synthetic woods base. Sorry, but it just doesn't work for me.\n\r\nJimmy Choo Man Blue opens with bergamot, clary sage, black pepper, and some aquatic elements, but unlike the original Jimmy Choo Man (2014), Jimmy Choo Man Intense (2016), or Jimmy Choo Man Ice (2017), there isn't a huge focus on fruit, calone, or anything that feels like a throwback to the 90's or early 2000's. With Jimmy Choo Man Blue, it's a thoroughly-current affair for better or worse, with little fruity sweetness. This inadvertently makes Jimmy Choo Man Blue the most mature offering, at least until the base sets in and destroys any respect one might have for this slight improvement overall. Nathalie Lorson has done some good work for Lalique and others when commercialism isn't the aim, but with this and her previous mainstream masculine effort Gentleman Givenchy (2017), it feels like she just phones in the accords the market research team prescribes to her, rather than do anything creative with it. The heart is a bit surprising, as this is where the ambroxan sits alongside a bit of leather, meaning the final dry down isn't actually a big glob of the stuff, but it's the only other pleasant quirk besides the dry opening before a \"Designer 101\" base of synthetic woods, vetiver, and a bit of vanilla settle down to a scratchy and cloying base of meh. Wear time is about 8 hours of medium projection, and the whole development happens in the first hour, so this is pretty linear to boot. I can't see somebody offending with this, but just like other entries in the line, it's unremarkable to an extreme, with the added no-no of a cloying scratchy base that could have been better-rounded or padded out with something to avoid that eventuality.\n\r\nI find Jimmy Choo Man Blue to actually be a bit more annoying than the original Jimmy Choo Man, with the Jimmy Choo Man Ice so far being the most wearable, even if that one is just a Dior Homme Cologne (2013) remix, so the track record for the house is not too hot, at least in my eyes. Of course, your mileage may vary, and if you end up liking the marine ambergris over leather, woods, and vanilla goulash that is served up by Nathalie Lorson, then by all means enjoy. My reception of the stuff should be a guidepost for an educated choice at most, not a deterrence to sample, so definitely cruise into an Ulta, Sephora, or Macy's to give this a sniff, especially if this genre is a fave. As for me, I've exposed myself to a lot of what the 2010's has to offer in the mainstream masculine veins, and although the unprecedented lack of variety has caused real market shifts (and needs correction before it's too late), there are still a few diamonds in the rough, but this just ain't one of them. In fact, I've not even heard or seen much on this until stumbling across the tester, almost as if this was released in a compulsory \"me too\" fashion and not actually meant to be promoted. Is Jimmy Choo just \"keeping up with the Joneses\" with this? Well, that would certainly explain the public access television-quality of the composition, and if that's the case, why even bother making masculines at all? You don't see Balenciaga putting out another men's fragrance, and although I do miss all the old ones, I'd rather them stay out of the game than make something nobody wants to wear, which is something Jimmy Choo doesn't seem to understand.

			"content": "I could write a really short review of this saying something to the effect of, \"Another generic 'blue' mall fragrance with a redundant blend of an aquatic ambroxan-laced heart, a synthetic vanilla/suede combo in the base, and typically fresh top notes to get things started off,\" and for certain people, this would probably suffice in describing it and give them enough that they need to know to stay away from it.  In fact I don't disagree with the reviews here which basically say this. For the most part, that's what Choo Man Blue is. If you're the type who dislikes modern mall fragrances, especially of the \"blue\" variety, and have grown tired of the ambroxan craze, particularly when it's used to create an aquatic effect of some sort, then stay away from this stuff. You'd probably find my description above apt and true to your experience. That's fine. I get why people don't like these scents and why they may be sick of them also. But there are still people out there who appreciate this genre of men's fragrances (am I among them? not really, but I don't hate them either) and would like to know the real differences between the various \"blue\" releases out there. This review is for those people. From what I've noticed, the Jimmy Choo brand doesn't exactly command respect or attention from fragrance enthusiasts. Therefore it would be very easy to cast aside Choo's \"blue\" release in favor of a brand with better name-recognition, like Versace or Armani, but to do so would be a mistake. There are some things about this one that I believe make it better than some of the leading brands out there, and reasons why it's worth exploring it if you're in the market for this type of scent. \n\r\nChoo Man Blue is actually one of the better \"Blue\" fragrances I've smelled recently. In fact it's a hell of a lot better than Versace Dylan Blue which I finally sampled for the first time last month. While I don't think it's a great fragrance, and it's certainly not anything particularly new, if you were a guy looking for one of these \"blue\" sorts of scents and didn't want to spend a whole lot, you could certainly do a lot worse than Choo Man Blue. \n\r\nHere's why this one is good: 1) The accord that sits at the top of the fragrance is nice. It's an interpretation of sage leaves and it has a pleasant aromatic balance between herbal-sweet and fresh. The notes have a rather crisp feeling and they maintain it for some time. Top notes often fade very quickly, but they hang on for a good amount of time here, about two hours at least, extending into the heart of the fragrance, and keeping that fresh, crisp top afloat. This is a good thing, and one reason why Choo Man Blue could be described as having decent structure.  2) The ambergris element is treated well here. Blue has a slightly salty, marine-like quality that becomes more evident in the heart and it pairs with the sage accord from the opening very well. The ambroxan or \"ambergris\" if you want to call it that, wasn't overdone, and instead it's used to give Blue a balanced proportion of salt and oceanic likeness. Some fragrances overdo the ambroxan in attempting to recreate a sea-like atmosphere and it ends up becoming to salty and sticky feeling, and clashes with the fruity top-notes they often employ. Choo Man Blue doesn't do this. It uses the ambroxan sparingly enough to keep things pleasant and uplifted, (and if it uses a lot of ambroxan, it at least blends it very well among the notes) and it blends it with an aromatic sage accord rather than a sticky fruity note, avoiding the clash that can result when that combination occurs. Finally, 3) Blue's dry down isn't terrible. It's pleasant even. So many perfumers choose to load up their bases with harsh synthetic woody aromachemicals these days, like norlimbanol (and call them cute words like \"akigalawood,\" and \"cashmeran\"), and as result these fragrances have horrible, scratchy, abrasive bases that can just ruin a scent. At least here Lorson went in a fairly soft and somewhat smooth direction instead, employing an easy going synth vanilla, a smooth if not abstract interpretation of suede, and sandalwood, which just kind of smells like some general variety of synthetic wood. Anyway, while the base isn't great or anything, it doesn't ruin the scent and is a fairly soft cushion for the fresh aromatics from the top and the ambergris heart to fade into. It even smells pretty nice. \n\r\nOverall, while this scent is one that has probably been smelled before in some variation or another, among the many \"Blue's\" that are out there, it's actually pretty decent. Seeing how it now goes for about $35 per 100ml I can definitely see how someone could do a lot worse than Choo Man Blue, and it could even make a solid choice for a man or young man looking for something modern and clean, but also a touch sensual or romantic. While I do think that something like this epitomizes the smells that are wafting out of your local mall fragrance section, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. It's also a nice fragrance because it smells a bit more mature than some of the other stuff that's out there right now, like Sauvage or Invictus...and that's because of the sage top notes (as opposed to something fruity) and restrained vanila/suede base (as opposed to \"intense\" woods). So yes, there's even a degree of elegance or sophistication here. Thumbs up, with a final rating of 7.5/10. Longevity is good, so is its projection. \n\r\nIt's very easy to overlook something like Choo Man Blue, and I can totally see why you would--we've seen enough of these types of scents and are bored with them by now--but it's important to point out that this is at least one of the better ones. While I'm not rushing out to buy a bottle, I enjoyed my sample of it.\n\r\nFinal note: Another \"blue\" fragrance that reminds me of Choo, in the sense that it's not one of the top brands but in fact executes its theme really well is Ferragamo Acqua Essenziale. This is more of a light, woody-aquatic than Choo Man Blue, which has more oriental qualities in comparison, so they're not exactly in the same genre, but it's still out there among the \"blue\" crowd, like Choo,  battling it out with more popular brands. I've always though Acqua Essenziale was better than it's credited for, and poorly recognized due to the saturation of its genre and its brand-name, and I believe Choo Man Blue will probably have the same fate. Neither fragrance is ground breaking or exceptionally good, but both are above average in their heavily-populated genre and better than some of their competitors with much more prestigious names. ",

I love that Amouage still takes these risks \u2013 there\u2019s nothing run of the mill about Imitation (one wonders if there will be sincere forms of flattery in years to come) and thus it is bound to be for unfocused groups, ie individuals.\r\nMy first encounter with it was in a store and it immediately turned everything else I had been sniffing grey. When a perfume can do that, it\u2019s leading not following. \r\nIn combining a cool, super-buffed aldehydic sheen that seems almost an olfactory counterpart to neon lights, vinyl, and sheer cellophane, with gutsy, juicy, flavoursome floral and fruity notes, Imitation presents a vortex of attraction, artifice and nature electrically conjoined.\r\nI tend to overspray this one because I love the vibrant blackcurrant top so much \u2013 I keep returning at intervals for more. It pops like you expect blackcurrants to and is cleverly accented by a touch of sweet postbox red roses. Then the florals start to kick in, the classic white flowers and rose combo, but with that almost citric aldehydic rush that seems to spin them around and present then in bright white light. This is so in the spirit of 1970s scents like Charlie, but only in the confidence of its mood \u2013 the execution is much more sophisticated. Part of that sophistication is the subtle use of smoke (incense) and a light powdery wood backing. \r\nIt\u2019s autumn turning to winter as I write this, and Imitation Woman has brought a burst of colour to the season. It\u2019s the promise of fun times bottled.\n",

Bigelow, I went for it and have been pleased.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a creamy, sweet, semi-sharp lavender-dominant fragrance with a mix of labdanum, tonka, benzoin, vanilla, and musk.  It\u2019s a nod to lavender fans while not being only lavender, and as with most fragrances, I appreciate its fairly heavy-handed sweetness to make it more endearing.  The resins and tonka blend effortlessly with the lavender in the dry down, where the fragrances becomes predictably more mellow than its semi-sharp opening.\n\r\nThe obligatory comparison to Lavender Extreme is pretty flattering for Lavande.  The two fragrances are very close in terms of smell, with Lavender Extreme being a bit creamier and featuring a pseudo \u201cPlay Doh\u201d vibe that many have mentioned, whereas Lavande has more of the resin/sharp tonka blend in the dry down.  Both perform comparably well\u2014good, but not great.  Certainly with its better pricing, Lavande comes out on top in terms of value, though it\u2019s totally fair that some might prefer the smell of Lavander Extreme.\n\r\nMolinard\u2019s current main collection of eau de parfum concentration purple bottles are all priced modestly, at $65 for 75ml, their collection seems interesting.  I\u2019ve my eye on several that I\u2019d be inclined to blind buy at even the retail pricing, which again is unusually reasonable for what seems to be a well-liked non-designer brand.\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m quite impressed with Lavande and look forward to smelling more of the brand.  This is, as the saying goes, quite the Lavender Extreme killer, even though I certainly still love Lavender Extreme, as well.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

The tonka smells like sweet tobacco leaves, sort of like hay, and a bit like boozy, vanilla-soaked woods.  It's complex and rich, and the mint does a good job lifting everything.  Though I barely smell lavender, I think it's there, raising the pitch of everything else and adding a touch of grit.\n\r\nHonestly, I don't usually like tonka as a featured note - it can have a petrol funk to it or just smell like bland wet cardboard.  I guessing that Komorebi works because it's using a much better tonka note than most perfumes, and has the good sense to let it shine.\n\r\nThis is what Roadster wishes it was.

			"content": "Smelling Irisoir, right from the opening, is a deeply satisfying experience to me. The orris is the unequivocal star of the first half hour, an exquisite delicacy of velvety, even buttery richness, violet-tinted woody elegance and just a hint of its rooty quirkiness. At the same time, a honeyed, slightly powdery floral heart steadily grows. Carnation, mimosa, lilac, almond-y helitrope are intricately intertwined into a fleecy bedding over smooth sandalwood and soft balsams, a luxurious, velvety mattress so soothing that the orris could all but fall deep within. This middle phase reminds me quite a bit of L'Heure Bleue, especially the sumptuous extrait de parfum (my reference is one from 90s). But Irisoir has a much stronger presence of orris and less of the anisic spiciness, tonka bean and other oriental elements. As a result, Irisoir feels much more floral in comparison, and more delicate and vibrant as well.\n\r\nA quiet whisper of peach can be heard throughout the composition as well. It's at first slightly bitter and woody besides its sweet-tart fruitiness, like the flavour close to its stone. When the elegant and enveloping floral heart gradually softens after about 6 hours, the peach gains a bit more prominence. It's now a tender fruity warmth mingled with the dainty, honeyed petals of rose, rendered suede-like thanks to the ever so plush orris. Irisoir maintains this adorably silky skin scent of orris, violet, peach and rose over a discreet salty vetiver until it disappears with a total longevity of at least 10 hours. It mostly stays close to the skin, although it projects slightly during its opening hour.\n\r\nIrisoir is described by some writers as a close contender to the mythical Iris Gris. As I've never smelt the original vintage version or the reconstructed one in Osmoth\u00e8que, I can't provide any comparison. But I would say that the peach is more like a supporting actor in this star-studded attar. And the L'Heure Bleue association stemming from its abstract yet nectarous, powdery floral heart, rather evokes to me the perfumery of the early 20s century, like Sultan Pasha himself described it as a tribute to La Belle Epoque. That being said, Irisoir does not feel like a mere copy, but a timeless beauty that truly is inspired by the classic perfumery and moves forward in a certain artisitic direction with the help of quality materials and exquisite blending. I'd highly recommend giving it a try, especially if you are an orris/iris fan or if you enjoy warm floral oriental \u00e0 la L'Heure Bleue.",

There are suggestions of rye-bread and of long-unopened sarcophagi.\r\nThis enclosed feeling persists even though the rose fades in the later stages to be replaced by a plummy, sweetish, cured tobacco with a hint of patchouli, infused with dry, peppery smoke. This is a perfume for the driven soul in the attic intent on writing the next Wuthering Heights.\r\nI would be remiss not to point out a significant drawback \u2013 this is a perfume that performs just fine while one is taking it easy but seems prone to flight upon exertion, even if slight.   \n",

It's a bit of a tough sell at retail, but under $100, it may turn a lot of heads like Gucci Intense Oud did years ago.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

			"content": "Heritage Jockey Club\n\r\nThose of you who have loved the original Caswell Jockey Club should steer clear of this new Heritage scent. The original had over two dozen botanicals, floral and herbal notes, resins, etc, making it one of the best fougeres ever created. Indeed, it was Caswell\u2019s second scent, created in 1840 and lasting until it was discontinued a few years ago. This new version contains none of the notes that were in the original, making the use of the name \u201cJockey Club\u201d misleading. Caswell should have been more responsible and created a new name for this product.\n\r\nThe Heritage version is a generic woody scent. Only a handful of notes are officially listed: thyme, basil, honey and rose, but dominating the scent is a bitter wood note that could be oud, agar or guaiac. I don\u2019t get the honey or the rose, just the bitter wood note and the dry notes of thyme and basil. It is no Jockey Club at all. Like \u201cchypre\u201d the term \u201cJockey Club\u201d has come to describe an entire genre of men\u2019s scent products.  These have included orange, lime, lavender, sandalwood, jasmine, rose, ambergris, lilac, orris and geranium leaf notes.\n\r\nLuckily, the original Caswell Jockey Club is still available from vintage sellers on the internet. Look for the blue box packaging with the grosgrain ribbon and the tall necked bottle.\n\r\nThis new Heritage version isn\u2019t awful, but it\u2019s just bland and generic smelling, most unworthy of the name.\n\n\n\n\n",

			"content": "Caswell-Massey entered the realm of niche because like most legacy perfumers not attached to a designer label and unable to throw millions towards marketing, their brand cachet had faded. The Heritage line was the first step in this direction, re-orchestrating clsssics to smell more modern, expensive, and palatable to the 21st century nouveau-niche lusting for distinction that matched their net worth. Humble old Caswell-Massey retained their original \"Gold Cap\" formulas and soaps so as not to alienate their installed fanbase, but created a \"level up\" tier from the Heritage line that contains new compositions as well, with R\u00d2S (2018) being one of them. This fragrance is marketed as a \"masculine rose\", no doubt inspired by the many niche and luxury examples from Middle Eastern houses filling the market. As such, R\u00d2S retains an oriental flair but is still decidedly Western in execution. Laurent Le Guernec has assisted here, as he has with all the niche-tier Caswell-Massey scents thus far, and the results are satisfactory if not a bit old-school.\n\r\nCaswell-Massey R\u00d2S opens with a soft bergamot and dark, jammy Turkish rose. They claim this comes from the \"Scepter'd Rose\" in Rockefeller Square, but I don't think NYC is going to let the perfumer chop down plants on a historical landmark just for perfume, even if there were somehow enough. The jammy rose leads into a tone similar to Azzaro Acteur (1989), with cardamom and anise supporting the heart, but in this case the amber stands alone without an isobutyl quinoline leather note like in the Azzaro, keeping R\u00d2S relatively rounded with hints of patchouli and musk in the final stages. I'm a huge sucker for a sweet jammy rose, and the anise really makes this stand out for me, but your tastes may vary. Wear time is average as is sillage, and as an eau de parfum, don't expect a ton of projection. R\u00d2S wears rather unisex in my mind, and is appropriate for romantic use in evenings from spring through fall. The rather simple composition reasserts the apothecary origins of America's oldest perfumer, but you have to really be a fan of the brand to choose this over the many options in the category, unless price point is a huge factor. \n\r\nTom Ford Noir de Noir (2007) is the leader in this category, but you'll pay twice as much for nearly half the juice, while Amouage Journey Man (2014) offers a similar experience with a heavier base. Hell, there's even Lady Vengeance by Juliette Has a Gun (2008) and Elizabeth & James Nirvana Rose (2016) for men unafraid of gender labels, so once again, it comes down to a bit of discretion concerning brand preference. Stuff such as Ungaro Pour L'Homme I (1991) is long discontinued and sells for obscene niche-level prices while the above Azzaro Acteur will eventually spiral into unobtanium for also being cut from production if it hasn't already by the time you read this, so under that mindset, R\u00d2S may be a more affordable replacement assuming Caswell-Massey keeps it. In any case, I doubt this would have been possible before the step up into niche realms since R\u00d2S goes completely against type for the house who makes it. R\u00d2S is a surprisingly elegant and desirable oriental rose amber for being from a house known more for powdery barbershop and floral styles of the 19th century, so it gets a big thumbs up.",

It's a real roll of the dice, because my first impression is that there is nothing out there like it. When they say \"unique\", they really mean it. And when they say \"niche\", they mean that, too. I am having a very hard time coming up with a good description, though I will do my best. I'm glad I bought it, but I think it's not a scent for impatient personalities. It has to grow on you. You have to come to the scent - to learn how to love it. It will not come to you. It has to be appreciated simply for what it is, without apology. Also, experimenting with application may be critical. People who expect to spray it on by some routine and it must work that way or money will be demanded back, will likely demand their money back. It's a grower. Don't give it a chance to grow, it won't.\n\r\nIn fact, of the four notes they list (tobacco, leather, cedar and oakmoss), I can detect every one of them, and yet none of them are so prominent that I would want to CALL it a leather, a chypre, a woody or a tobacco scent. They all contribute to a well-blended whole.\n\r\nOne of the first things I noticed - which is not listed anywhere - is incense. In fact, it immediately reminded me of Neil Morris and his crafty use of incense to mimic all sorts of things, though much more subtle. What I'm reading as incense may actually be dry and mineralic facets of the cedar, or there could be incense, but whatever it is, it's noticeable and pleasing.\n\r\nIf I had to describe the scent, it would be \"ambient old-school luxury\". I think the brief that is used in marketing is definitely what they were trying to achieve in the fragrance, while hiding any prominence of any of the components or accords they used to achieve it. It's basically hints of fine things - wood paneling and floors - leather furniture - vague tobacco - old perfumes - all kind of swirled together into a pleasant whole - a \"place\" that smells good. It isn't a standard niche perfume - it's more like Dans Tes Bras for an old gentleman's club or university club in New York City.",

And, yet, if that sounds off-putting, disregard that description, as we are dealing here with an impressive feat of balance.

The floral notes here are not obvious at all, except for a fleeting whiff of an incense-like champaca. The projection is low, & seven hours in it's faded to a very soft animalic base with just the ghost of a creamy white flower.\r\nI find this to be a pleasant unisex fragrance that might work well for me in autumn. However I'm giving it a neutral rating, because the listed notes of tuberose, gardenia & frangipani led me to expect an exotic & rich tropical floral, a genre that I adore.

It is the darkest, bitterest, most concentrated chypre I\u2019ve ever encountered. It begins with a burst of an anise accord, though this is not listed among its many ingredients. The pungent tobacco enters quickly and darkens rapidly as all the base notes surround it with the effect of aromatic roots and resins. Myrrh and frankincense dominate. \n\r\nThe tobacco accord begins to resemble a very black and bitter Havana cigar. The resins are too dark to consider this as an oriental \u2013 all base and no lift.

A man might pull it off, but one may not want to get too close to him.\n\r\nIt\u2019s not exactly offensive, but it is very off-putting and takes a great deal of time to get used to it.

It's definitely feminine and classic in tone -- a friend called it old-ladyish, and there's certainly nothing girlish or seductive about it. This scent reminds me of someone who is invariably well-attired, is always pleasant, makes good conversation, and never gives you the slightest insight into their inner or emotional life. Good armour for work.\n\r\nBoth EDT and EDP  are quite persistent, lasting a good 8+ hours on skin. This stuff is potent -- one spray will do, two will make a statement. The EDT is a 'larger' perfume, wafting around me for the entirety of its stay; the EDP is more polite, hugs closer to the skin, and has a tendency to disappear for a while before popping up again.\n\r\nDifferences: the EDT is ever-so-slightly sweeter than the EDP. In the EDT there's an almost caramelly richness in the drydown that's nevertheless not sugary or heavy -- nothing gourmand here. I suppose that's the labdanum. The drydown of the EDP is the world's chilliest, politest, least obtrusive patchouli -- how anyone could call this dirty is beyond me. (It's even more well-behaved than the drydown of Coromandel, which at least was once acquainted with fun.) In the EDP, the drydown seems deeper and more bitter --perhaps a more pronounced vetiver note?\n\r\nIn both EDT and EDP, it's a radiant, soft, well-blended fragrance in which the notes become very difficult to distinguish until the last hours.",

One note that's not listed is vetiver, which I swear I smell here, & which quickly overpowers everything else.

Mugler Alien Man opens weirdly with a fleeting synth watery amberish tonkinian accord plus a huge dose of yet up emerging cashmeran wood (overall averagely sweet, cinnamonic, dry and cedary a la Montblanc Legend Night) combined with top herbal, anisic (anise, dill), leafy floral (grassy bitter geranium) and aromatic elements balancing the synth ambery/spicy mildness and barely anchoring by soon the juice to a more classic aromatic/fougere tradition. Bitter herbs, hints of suedish leather and kind of pencil shavings smoked woods (a la Montblanc Legend) characterize the woody/leathery/herbal (darker and drier) dry down. Tonka, musk, geranium, lavender, aromatic herbs and dry woods \"recall\" the fruitier Montblanc Legend's woody-aromatic aura under my profane nose. Whereas Legend is fruitier and more sparkling (citric) in its top and central stage Alien Man is more focused on smoked woods, peppery spices and mild tonka. Leather, bitter herbs, a tad of rubber and smoked/pencil shavings woods provide a quite dry/woody final mark. Finally the persistence is really short on my skin.",

Well, I'm still testing, but everything indicates that this fragrance has an extended duration with those chemical scents that stick to the skin for a long time, seems to be the trend of the moment. I almost preferred it not to be this way and it would last a little less time, but more pleasant and not so artificial, I say, but I expect more analysis from other users to validate or not my first contact.I think I will most likely use this fragrance to accentuate or alter the structure of other fragrances (as I do sometimes with Santal Royal from Guerlain who despite having those chemical notes is much much better balanced than this one or others like the new Bulgarian Man Black ) - Well, let us wait and use another day or two and see what happens.But I think my worst fears are confirmed - after the initial phase the perfume that remains is almost completely dominated by the strong chemical aroma, smoke / leather / wood type, I can not really tell but it is not very pleasant.",

			"content": "This is actually a very nice low-key spicy fragrance for men. It maybe smells more like something from the 90's than today, but that's what makes it sort of refreshing and unique. It's a little tricky to explain how it smells; there's a sweet/fresh smell in the top that seems like it's part anise and mint, and part something else, a little greener and more herbal. I suppose it could be \"dill\" although it doesn't exactly smell like it, at least not the kind you cook with. But it lends a sweet/herbal/green aspect to the whole and actually plays a pretty significant roll in the overall smell. There's flashes of an herbal, green variety of lavender here as well, but it's quiet, softer, and blends in and out with the anise, mint, and dill. Beneath its sweeter, fresher side, Alien Man shows some soft suede and a cozy, almost-smoky cashmere wood embellished with pepper. While it's not prominent or dominating at a any moment, I get a good dose of pepper in Alien Man, and it seems to be what gives it most of its spicy character. I have to say that the base is very nice. The cashmere wood is soft, and while it's entwined with amber, it's not THAT woody-amber smell that's everywhere (those sort of chemical, scratchy-fuzzy sweet woods). It's much easier on the nose and stays more in the background rather than taking over and dominating as the other kind usually does. The suede is also a nice touch, and it lends a smooth, rounded texture to the base as well its subtle, unique smell. Finally, amber by itself also emerges in the base, and in the beginning this one has a crusty, salt-licked little edge to it that almost suggests an animalic quality or freshly sweaty skin. But it's very low-key and dialed back at the same time, something you might not notice at first, but could if you looked for it. Finally, the amber takes on a more powdery-sweet, white-ish hue and this is the last stage of the fragrance's development. Though it retains traces of what preceded it, in the end it is mostly amber which dominates. \n\r\nI guess I could have written a much shorter review of Alien Man and said \"it's a spicy-fresh, sweet herbal fragrance for men with some soft cashmere wood and suede in the base,\" and to some extent, that's what it is, but I don't think that would give you any real idea of its smell. I'm still not sure if the description above exactly nails it, but if you can't obtain a sample, it may at least give you a rough idea of what it's like.\n\r\nOne thing Alien Man is not, is generic. I don't know where those comments came from. I haven't smelled one recent release that comes even close to smelling like Alien Man. The sweetness in its top is not some vague fruit concoction, or tonka-laden lavender, or pink pepper/cinnamon blend you could find in a bunch of other fragrances--it's a sort of bizarre but pleasant herbal-green sweetness infused with anise and mint. And the base is a soft, easy-going cushion of gentle woods and suede. It's not bursting at the seams with aroma chemicals; it's not presenting some form of \"hyper-fresh\" woods, nostril piercing in their tenacity and pitch. If the woods in Alien Man don't exactly smell natural, they at least smell pleasant and approachable. \n\r\nBut I understand the ho-hum reactions to this one. I understand the disappointment. Mugler is a company known for its bombastic, over-the-top creations, beginning with A*Men and ending with whatever was the latest A*Men flanker in a very long line of A*Men flankers. So when it was announced they were releasing a new men's fragrance, everyone's mind naturally went to this big, loud, impressive place. Meanwhile Alien Man went the other way. It went somewhere quiet and understated, opting for finesse and restraint over fireworks and volume. There's no real \"wow factor\" to Alien Man. It's not going to knock your socks off or blow your mind. But at the same time, it smells really nice. It the type of fragrance that has signature-scent potential. You can wear it everywhere and anywhere, and nobody's going to ask you to leave the room because you stink. In fact, most people will probably react well to it just because it smells so nice. I can't say the same for Ultra Zest or Pure Leather or Pure Malt or Kryptomint. Even though I love many of these scents, wearing them can be a crapshoot. In the end, I think Mugler made the right choice here. By releasing Alien Man they added a versatile, understated, and easy-to-wear option to their lineup. And they've still left plenty of room for Alien Man Intense. \n\r\nAlien Man's performance is solid, and 5 good sprays seem to do trick and really get it rolling. Projection is moderate, but present, as it should be for a scent like this. It creates a nice smell around its subject but doesn't shout. Longevity is about 8 hours. As far as seasons, I think this could be worn any time of the year save for the hottest months, and as far as occasions it seems to have good range, from the most casual situations to more formal, dressy events. As stated earlier, it's the kind of fragrance that could be used as a signature scent. \n\r\nIn approaching Alien Man I finally followed my New Year's resolution and ordered a sample rather than blind buying a full bottle, but now that my sample has run out, it looks like a bottle is on the horizon. Different enough from anything else I own and something that will be easy and fun to wear, Alien Man gets an overall score of 8 out of 10 and is recommended for sampling. Go into this one with tempered expectations and you may enjoy it.\n\n\r\nUPDATE: This is much STRONGER than I'd been lead to believe at first. I get more than above average projection and a solid 8 to 10 hour longevity every time I wear this. It's also taken a bit of a darker turn, losing some of its greenness and resembling more the dark color purple of the flacon. I really, really enjoy this.\n\n",

			"content": "Thierry Mugler Alien Man (2018) was a long time coming, with the original Alien (2005) having been released more than a decade prior. In the years between, there was a lot of hype and whispering about what the scent would be, since A*Men (1996) was still carrying the brand as the flagship for men for more than twenty years with a host of flankers before this first major pillar successor finally showed up. Was Alien Man to be as daring and challenging as the original A*Men was decades before it? Well... sorta yes and sorta no. I don't think perfumer Jean-Christophe Herault was trying to replicate the same vibe as A*Men with Alien Man, or even the same vibe as the original feminine Alien perfume had, but definitely borrowed DNA from both for this novel composition. Alien Man is part daring, part comfort, part genderbend, part safety through conventional design, but all good in the end. Alien Man is a chimera to wear, as there are a few gourmand notes in Alien Man, but this is no pure gourmand, and likewise some classic 90's \"fresh foug\u00e8re\" notes run through Alien Man as well, drawing some comparison to Montblanc Legend (2011). There is even a bit of floral oriental \"floriental\" play here, making this similar in ever-so-slight ways to Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb (2005). Whatever is going on in Alien Man, it is nothing like what anyone else is doing in the men's sector, giving me hope that designers haven't fully resigned themselves to aromachemical cocktails with no real distinction after the creative rut of the 2010's. The construction of Alien Man is based around three \"vibrations\", which are really just the top, heart, and base under new names to give the stuff the usual \"Mugler weirdness\" effect, but it works.\n\r\n The \"electric vibrations\" top is anise, dill, and smoked beach wood. Nothing about that top sounds even remotely conventional, and while I can't confirm what that \"smoked beach wood\" is made of, I get some birch tar, slight vetiver smoke, and mandarin that burns off pretty quick. The dill note is detectable, and very interesting but not off-putting. No, the opening of Alien Man does not smell like pickles, since there is no vinegar next to that dill, but the very unique smell of this herb is softened some by the anise to make an unorthodox but befitting aromatic introduction. Cashmeran comes in a like a body pillow in the heart, flanked by a sweet osmanthus that could destroy the composition in a ball of apricot-like sweetness if not for cedar and leather that follow. The osmanthus combines with this suede-like leather to produce a toned-down version of the main vibe found in Auphorie Miyako (2015), which is a niche artisinal perfume connection I would never dream of making with a designer masculine. The genderbending here is a ballet of trading soft blows, and the \"sensual vibrations\" of the heart is aptly named. Base notes or \"magnetic vibrations\", consist of deftly-handled orcanox, which is a softer/finer shade of the ambroxide molecule usually abused to great degree in other 2010's masculines, but plays only a background role alongside patchouli, tonka, and synthetic oakmoss smell in the form of evernyl to complete a late-stage foug\u00e8re-like accord thanks to the anise in the top. Smooth, complex, blended, and very hard to grasp, Alien Man is less confrontational than the classic A*Men, but no less disorienting upon first sniff. Wear time is adequate and sillage is more moderate than you might expect, but the problem is where this fits in a wardrobe. Part of me wants to call the smell of Alien Man office safe, but part of me doesn't since that osmanthus and leather is still very lurid despite having some counterbalances like the cashmeran and cedar. Curiouser and curiouser...\n\r\nLikewise, the familiar foug\u00e8re finish is just that, and not the bulk of the wear, which transforms from smokey-sweet gourmand to \"fruity floriental\" in the heart, before finally settling on that very 90's \"fresh foug\u00e8re\" end point, making an appropriately \"alien\" experience for you and anyone around you smelling what you're wearing. I guess this is a sleeper romantic scent with some office-safe aspects but too much flirt in its step to be taken around strangers. The rich nature of Alien Man makes it a cooler weather scent, as it sits in a nexus between the gourmand/oriental/floral/foug\u00e8re categories, feeling abstractly fresh but a warm scent at the same time, insufficient for hot weather. Alien Man is not for folks who hate sweetness, or any form of ambroxide/ambroxan/orcanox/ambrox super, since the stuff is still here even if handled deftly. Alien Man took a year to hit US stores after being released in Europe and I can see why: this is a very risky scent and risky scents don't usually make it into designer realms anymore outside of maybe Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme (2017) or Dunhill Icon (2015), which were risky only because they're both stylistic throwbacks. Whatever you want to make of Alien Man, you can't deny its creativity (even if it tries a little too hard), and I rather enjoy the scent so I give it a thumbs up, but it will require some time from you before drawing any conclusions. One thing's for sure: Alien Man is proof positive why the house of Thierry Mugler gets so much talk in perfume circles, regardless of gender or age, and why they are seen more by enthusiasts as perfume art rather than just another \"symbol of refinement\" luxury good like so many other brands out there in the world.

			"content": "If this fragrance is so mainstream and boring, why is it that I, as someone who has quite a wide-ranging and varied collection filled with challenging, left-field niche favorites, find myself wearing Alien Man every other day in the week since it arrived? I ordered it \u201cblind\u201d with low expectations given the ho-hum reception it\u2019s received online. Fair enough. Can I understand why people are let down, given Mugler\u2019s history of challenging, idiosyncratic, and cheeky compositions? Yes, of course. Alien Man is in no sense ostentatious. It\u2019s not loud, it\u2019s not brash, it doesn\u2019t make a big statement. But, what it manages to be in a way that is rare, is simultaneously easy-going and broadly appealing without being insipid, cheap, or trite. Alien Man is not particularly alien in the sense of being weird. However, it does play with a sense of texture and aura, a sort of electricity, that draws on another connotation of \u201calien.\u201d As others have mentioned, it opens with a somewhat rich, anise-touched bracingness, notably lacking obvious citrus, the effect of which, aided by birch smokiness, is like a low-level electrical current has been turned on. The fragrance hums. As it develops, it turns toward a slightly synthetic lavender-esque quality which I fear is a bit of dihydromyrcenol, though used sparingly enough that this may be the first composition where I can stand that completely overused aromachemical. Along with this cheerful \u201cwell groomed\u201d note, a somewhat leathery, somewhat creamy amber woods warms up, never shouting, and developing into a sensual \u201cwarm skin\u201d glow which lasts, very pleasantly, for many hours more. The effect is somewhat like static electricity. Where other, more cynical mass-market compositions would lean heavily on a cheap woody-amber base, or dud out after a showy opening, Alien Man keeps its integrity and affable sensibility throughout, neither offending nor caving to crassness. There\u2019s something so appealingly reliable about this sort of composition \u2014 never a bad choice, will not betray you with an easy out \u2014 that it does indeed become addictive, something to reach for happily. There\u2019s no need to put this up against fragrances designed to make a statement; that\u2019s not what Alien Man does. But put up against other appeals to a wide market, and its smart take on approachability is the way to go. Even the most rarified, esoteric collection needs something like this, for all those days where the aim isn\u2019t a shout, but a smart sport coat and an easy smile. I\u2019ve started seeing Alien Man as more about an attitude or atmosphere than a classically-structured fragrance. Honestly, if it weren\u2019t taken by Mugler\u2019s other new flagship, Aura would have been an even better name. Approach it that way, it it all makes much more sense.",

			"content": "I kid you not...for many years, I'd see the Alien perfume for ladies and wonder, \"Will Thierry Mugler ever make a version for men?\"\n\r\nAnd here it is in 2018 (I take no credit, LOL).  I just got a sample today and will share my impressions of it:\n\r\nInitial spray hits me with a bunch of memories of \"Amber\" by L'Occitane, so smooth and mildly spicy and relaxing.  Patchouli is quite evident as well.  A very woody presence is there too, as if it's sandalwood or some other precious wood - maybe cedar?  Fragments of leather do seem to arise as well, along with wisps of aniseed.\n\r\nThe effect I get of Alien Man: A dry, aromatic amber and wood oriental scent, accented by spices.  It doesn't resemble the \"A*Men\" myriad of flankers, save for the patchouli-centered ones (i.e. Kryptomint, Pure Shot, and Ice*Men).  It is sweeter and lasts a good while.\n\r\nAnd incidentally, I can't really confirm if some of the notes listed above (e.g. dill and osmanthus) are truly present or not.  But overall, I appreciate what I DO recognize as a fresh, amber-y frangrance unlike most of the men's scents in Thierry Mugler's collection.",

The opening citrus peel elements (bergamot and green mandarin) add a slight brightness, which mixes naturally with the full lavander heartnote. As with all the other Codes, A-List features the sensual tonka bean note that points right to the guiac wood foundation.\n\r\nCompared to the original, A-List has some more depth and colorful appeal.  It waxes more formal and fits with a suit, for sure.  It does seem to be a bit lighter in density than the original, meaning it will require careful application of layers of the scent to avoid fading out too early.\n\r\nOverall, this is a genuinely pleasant scent that I'd hasten to call \"Armani Code Light\", as the \"Colonia\" edition explores the Eau de Cologne side of Code but doesn't act the part of a \"light\" Code per se.

			"content": "I'm sad to admit that the first time I tested this, I was underwhelmed. I had been at Ulta for well over an hour, and looking back, I'm pretty sure that my nose was fatigued. At any rate, I wrote this off as boring berries, saddened that it did not live up to the Homme version that I love so much.\n\r\nFast forward a few months, and a kind fellow fragrance lover sent me a care package of decants: Bottega Veneta, Salvatore Ferragamo, Herm\u00e8s, and buried under the rest, Gucci Guilty Absolute pour Femme. I spritzed it on as an afterthought, and then I stopped in my tracks.\n\r\nThis is the kind of fragrance that takes your breath away. Instead of the muted berries I remembered from Ulta, I experienced the needle-sharp, monsterous cypress note that endeared me to pour Homme (even more than the famous gasoline/leather accord). Right behind the roaring cypress came mouth-puckeringly sour berries alongside a big, fat rose that's at once nice and jammy but also somehow ice cold. Farther in the dry-down, there is the faintest hint of leather, more akin to TF's Ombre Leather than to GGA pour Homme, but pleasant and still a fitting homage to the masculine.\n\r\nI'm going to hop off the train for a moment to say that the longevity isn't great, about 4-6 hours on me if I'm lucky and a skin scent after 2 hours (I have dry skin that eats scent, so take that for what it's worth). I definitely have to carry my decant with me to freshen up during the day, but the opening is so gorgeous that I'd probably respray several times a day regardless.\n\r\nThere are so many things to love here (just look at Redneck Perfumisto's review! So many words in prose from our resident poet!), but the clencher for me is that cypress. Evergreens are a weak spot for me, and this is one of the most beautiful evergreen scents I've had the pleasure of wearing. Backup bottle-worthy x10 for me.",

			"content": "Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme is a refreshing departure and nice complement to the fittingly more masculine leather-and-patchouli Pour Homme released last year.  Femme involves a blend of blackberry, rose, woods, and patchouli primarily, the blackberry starting off strong and heady but remaining a part of the mix throughout the life of the fragrance, blending excellently with the heart of rose and eventually a more relaxed base of patchouli, leather, and goldenwood.  I don't get much of the leather, or the vetiver in the heart, for that matte, as it's mainly the blackberry and rose that are doing the heavy lifting, at least on my skin.\n\r\nCertainly marketed for women with the floral/fruity dominance, I nevertheless regard it as unisex, especially for men like me that are fans of rose.\n\r\nIts performance is great, well above average, and Femme, like Homme, is widely available on the secondary market, despite having scaled-up pricing from Homme (Guilty Oud's pricing is higher still), and Femme can generally be found in the $50-$80 range for its standard 90ml size (the largest, unlike Homme, which comes in 150ml as well).\n\r\nDefinitely a recommended try for men and women alike, not to be blind bought but certainly to be backed up if loved as I love it.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

It is wildly exceeding even my already high expectations.\n\r\n...\n\r\nThere is enormous relationship to the men's. I thought that would be too difficult - that they couldn't connect to that raw leathery quality of the men's Absolute that appeals to men, and still make something that could appeal to women and be feminine, but I was wrong. This is feminine, but the homage to the men's is so strong, and the rose is so perfect and rich - improved by the berry - that men will absolutely want to steal it. Male fans of strong niche rose scents will be sorely tempted!!! It's more feminine than most of those scents, but not in a scary way.\n\r\nAs for women, I would say that women who wanted their own Egoiste have it now, except this is not a Chanel - it's its own style - old Gucci.\n\r\n...\n\r\nIt's all very rich and self-supporting. The components improve each other - they don't fight each other. That first sniff - it was like it just got better and better and I was going WTF!!! The patchouli and rose are perfect together. The berry is just restrained enough that it can have its full power and prominence while not being so typically excessive. The berry makes the rose much more interesting. The oily, leathery character of the men's shows through underneath the rose and the berry, making both appealing in a way which is hard to describe - mature yet young. A great balance between new and old makes it smell exactly like the visual marketing. Perhaps I sense a bit more leather, but I'm looking for it!\n\r\n...\n\r\nWow - there is a point about 10 or 15 seconds into this, where it just amazing. It's very rich, complex and \"golden\". Reminiscent of the magic moment when POAL is getting started. But now as it sits on my skin, the dark patchouli and woody notes and amber show through the rose and berry and the whole thing is very symphonic. Most important are the parts that reflect the men's fragrance. Woody, leathery, oily - the interesting stuff that makes women want to poach Fahrenheit is there to make MEN want to poach this one.\n\r\n...\n\r\nI should mention that it is NOT unfaithful to the Guilty line - it definitely follows the original women's scent, which was the best of the bunch, IMO, until now. But this is daring to go in some new directions. Comparisons to some of the best niche rose fragrances from the TOP houses are not unwarranted. This is a definite match for the men's. A very conscious and precise one.\n\r\n...\n\r\nWill it make me dream? No question! This colors my thoughts already! It's a powerful fashion statement.",

Patchouli and vetiver give it an orris-like dryness and tonka bean blends with the heart note of ylang ylang to wrap it in a vanilla-like veil.\n\r\nThe blending of gardenia, rose, jasmine, lily and heliotrope provide the floral bouquet.\n\r\nColoris reminds me of the rich perfumes of Weil, designed to enhance furs.

This is a nice floral-fruity dyad, which is given additional freshness by a grapefruit and also by whiffs of an orangey nature.  The rose is on the brighter side. \n\r\nThe drydown witnesses a change of the rose, with the aroma of the stem and the rose leaves most prominent now; the actual rose blossom is in the background at this stage.  Some slightly darker violet impressions add some complexity and development.  \n\r\nThe base brings in a restored vanilla, which is not very intensive and hence not in danger of taking over; this is a vanilla that is not particularly intrusive and certainly never cloying.  That is true for the mix as a whole, and although the rose is sweet, of course, it is a civilised sweetness that is never very strong. \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, very good projection and eleven hours of longevity on my skin, albeit close to the latter towards the end.  \n\r\nA very agreeable spring rose scent, not without an original twist, that might not be particularly exciting especially in the later stages, but it is crafted well and the performance is good.  3.25/5.

That said, it's certainly not on par with the quality of better amber fragrances like the aforementioned.  It does perform well, though, with loud projection for an hour and modest to slightly loud projection for another couple hours thereafter.

			"content": "\n\n\r\nLouis Vuitton began a push between 2016 and 2019 towards a collection of fragrances scaled to fit the niche mould and to announce a strongarmed re-entry for those already beholden to the house as well as the well-moneyed looky-loos drawn to anything marketed as upscale. L\u2019Immensite arrives alongside the class of 2018 (Nouveau Monde, Au Hasard, Orage, Ombre Nomad, and Sur la Route), each pointed in a masculine direction.\n\r\nTo be fair, I arrived at the Louis Vuitton boutique with the initial intention to procure a sample of Afternoon Swim (2019). While discussing the fragrance line with the SA its bright and limpid cobalt blue bottle really leapt out from the backdrop; in fact, amongst the beige-bedecked shelves of various leather, canvas and upper echelon ready-to-wear refinement this particular bottle was a uniquely happy expression against the more staid LV collection. But, alas, having been a popular scent this Summer, and with all of their samples gone, the SA encouraged me to take a sample of L\u2019Immensit\u00e9 (2018) which she described as very popular amongst their male clients and, with their program in place that allows bottle refills at a $100 discount for devoted returnees, it was already the most commonly sought-after at this boutique since its release almost two years earlier. I was surprised to learn this because I heard that Orage and Sur la Route were more popular.\n\r\nIn much the same way that Creed prior to Aventus (2010) might arguably be known to represent the high-brow nouveau riche refinement of previously established scent profiles from other houses, the same might be said of LV in this case. In fact, it must be stated because others will continue to point this out elsewhere. Deservedly so. More on that in a moment.\n\r\nAlthough one might be suspect of such a high-profile brand\u2019s sense of originality L\u2019Immensit\u00e9 is nevertheless a gorgeous, well-wrought structure that it cannot be denied. This Jacques Cavallier rendering is luxurious and imminently wearable for many occasions, from casual to more formal. As per the brand mythos there is warranted sophistication about it that cannot be denied. It feels good wearing this, though I wonder if something approaching $300 for a bottle could ever really be warranted, and here again we return to the subject of originality in the context of value . . . perhaps, just perhaps, if one loves this enough then the $100 savings for a refill at an official LV boutique might work, but this will only be when an individual has found something worthy of recycling through their collection. I believe for some people it is. Undoubtedly. Then again, for others who need not be sold any further on niche prestige \u2013 let alone their own subscriptions to LV itself as both a brand and lifestyle \u2013 this will be less of philosophical jump. And for those with socio-economic clout there will be no mental exercise to justify the acquisition. Lucky them!\n\r\nRegarding the question of originality as viewed in the context of the ineluctable scent profile? Yes, those possessing a much stronger grasp of the history of perfumery than myself can effortlessly list inspirations for L\u2019Immensit\u00e9. Paco Rabanne Pour Homme (1973), a slight reference to Azzaro Pour Homme (1976) but definitely without the leather and oakmoss, and some combination of a few Acqua di Gi\u00f4 editions by Giorgio Armani. And damn straight that list could include something more modern such as Bleu de Chanel (2010) and Dior Sauvage (2015) because of the flirtations with freshy + Ambroxan. Maybe this is the elite version of Sauvage? I dunno. I don\u2019t really want to go there. From my limited vantage point this appears more of a fresh reference to the 1990s where, to be honest, where they were then youthful there now exists a mid-career demographic for whom this naturally might appeal and, moreover, have arrived at that stage in life where they could splurge for this, amongst other class-conscious markers of their bourgeois dynastic pretensions.\n\r\nFrom the initial blast there is excitement and something that sparkles. Non-existent is that alcohol false start that you need to wait for before things click. From the outset L\u2019Immensit\u00e9 is present and strong. The opening feels fresh and fruity, the ginger and grapefruit feel real, boisterous and unimagined by some synthetic Frankensteining. Someone I know who shares my love of the scent charms from Herm\u00e8s loves Twilly d\u2019Herm\u00e8s (2017) whose ginger profile I\u2019ve never been able to wrap my head around. I\u2019m not normally of an appreciative nose for ginger outside of the medicinal and Thai cuisine. What we are offered here is a \u201cpickled ginger\u201d but I can assure you that it doesn\u2019t swerve towards something sour or too pungent; this is controlled and balanced with the juicy grapefruit that (mostly) disavows any bitter traces, as well as a tart bergamot that I detect that adds to the obligatory masculine freshness. These top notes (ginger, juicy grapefruit, citrus) are the most exciting and memorable. The opening is generous and invigorating. Indeed, hold the opening dear, for it\u2019s exciting and remains for a while. A dry none-too-sour freshness and a water note help to create something reminiscent of sporty and a little aquatic. This fragrance is not a rush towards the base and, ultimately, the finish line. There is Ambroxan, yes, but unlike Sauvage (2015) this is no Ambroxan bomb crater that envelops everything in place and ultimately directs this journey. It\u2019s a more subtle saucer. The labdanum encourages a smooth undertone that warms the other ingredients like rocks on a windy bank in the Mediterranean sun. Only slightly musky. Something else that is dry and spicy holds itself close to the rocks and perhaps that is the sage and rosemary, though the blending of this is so expertly done that my nose fails to detect those individual notes. And finally the shorter leash on the Ambroxan and the lovely laddanum allow the amber to fulfill one of the most qualified and ideal amber balancing effects I\u2019ve witnessed in a long time. While the amber and labdanum are pushed down more, the constant hover of ginger all work together to keep it warm \u2013 this ensures a base of resinous wood and all the assurances of a masculine countenance. Nothing full sporty, nothing full aquatic. Sillage is good and longevity comes in at a respectable 5-6 hours on my skin.\n\r\nL\u2019Immensit\u00e9 opens beautifully. Carries and asserts itself beautifully. Dries down beautifully. An image for this scent is walking on a dry hot day along a rocky path metres above the sea. The rocks have been bathed white in the unrelenting sun for a millennia and there is a low foliage that has managed to survive there. The wind bores through the rocky face of this hill and carries with it a delightfully warm, spicy accord. The sunny sparkle of the water in the distance below brings an inviting zest to the equation. Yes, this feels Mediterranean but not the bright citrus along its shores like a Neroli Portofino (2007). Rather, the location here is a dry landscape above its water, but whose placement I couldn\u2019t guess. Nothing is fleeting, everything feels timeless. Noble invigoration.\n\r\nSure, a wee bit of a crowd pleaser.\n\r\nFresh, aromatic, spicy, decidedly masculine with a heritage scent profile deserving of a reboot from any house. There is a substantial quality to L\u2019Immensit\u00e9. But now it\u2019s time to pay the piper and the question of price/value invariably persists. Not unlike Creed who arguably prior to Aventus, issued elite renditions of seminal (and current!) works, LV is following the same playbook here. Is this a bad thing? \u2013 I don\u2019t know. But when critical crunch time arrives it must be stated that any worthy criticism should surely be amortized across other brands who have done the same (cough, cough . . . Parfums de Marly and sometimes Frederic Malle). Let us be fair.\n\r\nI laboured quite a bit with rating this and knew what I was up against. Yes, it would be so easy to be utterly dismissive from an antiquated fraghead perspective and thusly accord it a negative rating. After all, a grasp of perfume heritage is itself noble and welcomed, as I have respectfully learned in all of my readings on Basenotes. Lacking originality, borrowing historically under the assumption that some high-quality note edits would justifiably lift this to respectability, and vaulting this into upper echelon niche pricing, all are enough credible points from the \u201cI object!\u201d side. But something here wouldn\u2019t be fair, if not even somewhat disingenuous, for this exercise could only be mounted with eyes wide shut. I might even say it could be a kneejerk reaction from the fraghead hostile-ites. In this light this would be patently unfair. Regardless this is a conundrum and, as such, perhaps a neutral rating is more reliable. There will be a struggle with this one and for that I applaud the honesty.\n\r\nBecause this is my review and I am not beholden to the measure of expectations or trials of others. I can give my take:  To me L\u2019Immensit\u00e9 is undeniably a luxurious \u2013 albeit unoriginal \u2013 fragrance that deserves to be considered alongside its current and historical specimens of this scent profile. Yet it clearly does not just couple together these previously established profiles with an inherently insane price tag; instead the quality of the ingredients is undeniably high and the experience noteworthy. This is a beautifully-blended concoction that keeps inviting your nose to your forearm time and again throughout the day to appreciate said ingredients. If anything, this is a respectable shout-out to an established heritage and nothing about the manner in which it is presented or marketed suggests that LV and Jacques Cavallier were trying to mislead us. It can be embraced for quality\u2019s sake on an already established platform, not unlike any number of ready-made commodities who shift the everyman into a lap of luxury. One could say this is analogous to a mid-range Mercedes-Benz C-Class (C300, for example) prior to the AMG performance arm of the company preying upon it for dizzying levels of performance and luxury upgrades, hence the AMG C63 S saloon. In that regard, the AMG division made its name by taking the underpinnings in order to produce something that invited more luxurious exterior and interior appointments, in addition to a notable crank in horsepower. If that is too much hyperbole then perhaps a Toyota pumpkin becoming a Lexus lion is easier on the conscience.\n\r\nIn the end I give this one a neutral rating and this is not due to matters of originality, it is not due to matters of what has been borrowed or what is deemed generic, and it is certainly not a reactionist discord with the perceived haughtiness of the LV house. Rather, in the end it MUST come down to, yes, the insane price in this consideration. Where I live it costs $290. Were it priced at, say, $180 I might view the 60% surcharge for the otherwise excellent ingredients as worth it when compared to similar fragrances. However, here\u2019s the rub:  For those individuals who sample and love I\u2019Immensite to the point it might eventually warrant a second bottle, then suddenly this approaches a positive rating. Why? \u2013 because at a stated refill cost of $190 this then falls into the parameter I imagined above for a positive rating. Regardless, I eagerly suggest to the curious to kindly request a sample of l\u2019Immensite and decide for yourself what might lie ahead for you. In conclusion, try it in case this runs with the classic steeds for you. Just start somewhere. Decant worthy at least.\n\r\nPrice be damned but it\u2019s damned good.\n\n\n",

			"content": "This is a rose and oud perfume, and there's no surprise here, but it is well done, smells appropriately \"expensive\" to suit the luxury Veblen model of Louis Vuitton, and also has the appropriate minimalist bottle presentation to be in step with niche perfume practices. Louis Vuitton Nouveau Monde (2018) is more than just a well-researched Western take on a Middle Eastern genre, as the phenomenal talents of Jacques Cavallier are brought to bear here (as with all the Louis Vuitton line) since he has been mostly adopted as house perfumer for the venerable designer's leap into the prestige perfume segment. This won't tickle the fancy of hardcore oud aficionados, but Nouveau Monde is good if the price is right. Nouveau Monde is also part of the huge initial roll-out of scents for Louis Vuitton and can currently be sampled only in boutiques or stores specifically consigned to sell the line like Neiman Marcus, so getting your hands on a sample may be tricky until this stuff has infiltrated the gray market a bit and starts appearing on sampling sites for decant purchases. \n\r\nRose and saffron come out of the gate with a leathery barnyard oud similar to Christian Dior Leather Oud (2010), but with the jock strap smell toned down a few notches by comparison. Jacques Cavallier must have taken notes from Fran\u00e7ois Demachay in the oud presentation department, but complicates things with the additional gourmand elements of caramel and vanilla in the heart, then that oud in the base flanked by an olibanum incense note, amber, and sandalwood. I'm sure everything here is at least adulterated with synthetics if not entirely artificial, since this is $250 for 100ml and not $500 for 30ml of extrait, but it performs appropriately with good sillage and all-day longevity.\r\nI can't say much more than that about Nouveau Monde, as it really is just a swirl of Western oud takes in a blender, with an uncommonly animalic growl usually reserved for the real deal, but dialed back to Western tolerances of politeness. Still, this should only be used romantically and likely not in sweltering heat unless you are very audacious with fragrance. \n\r\nMidway between the rose of Montale Black Aoud (2006) and the leather/oud tandem of Leather Oud, Nouveau Monde is a \"more the merrier\" kind of addition to a niche perfume fan who doesn't flinch on price and wants several variations on a theme. Since this isn't loaded down with patchouli like the Aramis Perfume Calligraphy (2012) line, or extremely medicinal cut with amber or tobacco like the host of oud flankers produced by Versace, Armani, or Varvatos, Nouveau Monde may feel worth the sticker price if something like Oudh Infini from Parfums Dusita (2015) scares you and Areej le Dor\u00e9 Russian Oud (2018) is too scarce to be bothered fighting over. For the asking price of $250, there are still many other things I'd personally choose over this, like Diptyque Oud Palao (2015), which brings a similar barnyard rose oud to the table with a bit of a darker unfettered tone that I prefer, but Nouveau Monde is certainly worth a sampling to anyone looking to drop some coin on a quality Western oud take that doesn't smell like a seventh generation YSL M7 (2002), which is ironically another oud fragrance touched by the hands of Jacques Cavallier.

It's like the whole spice rack was dipped in vanilla and amber, a noticeably sweet side contrasting a variety of spices.  The note listing covers it all but the main vibe I get is a blend of saffron, tobacco, nutmeg, amber, and cedar.  There's a vaguely green, fresh, vegetable concept to it, but it's slight and only noticeably in the opening hour or so.\n\r\nDue to the spicy and nutty sides of it, Kiviskin feels more appropriate for cold weather.  I don't have a remotely stereotypical read on gender, though--it's not particularly feminine or masculine.\n\r\nIf you're one to be in the market for unusual fragrance offerings, I imagine Kiviskin might be very rewarding for some, and on the other hand, it would defy norms, like Bluebijou, especially, but not really conforming to a preconceived notion (i.e. designer) of fragrance.\n\r\nPiotr Czarnecki fragrances seem to be still exclusively sold at Luckyscent with standard 100ml bottles, with Kiviskin being the most expensive in the line at $195 for 100ml; Bluebijou and Venom of Angel are both $175 and the originals, Shihan and She Shihan, are $160.\n\r\nFor me, Kiviskin is a like not a love but I'll enjoy occasionally reaching for the decant for something interesting and different.\n\r\n7 out of 10 ",

At least with Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Essenza (2012), a cult following developed around the greener and sharper take on the old formula despite the overall commercial failure of the scent, but with Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu (2018), it seems Armani aren't even trying anymore and just falling in line with 2010's \"ambroxanbomb\" trends. What's more startling is Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu not only feels uninspired, but also like an edit of a Cecile Maton's Stronger With You (2017) for the upper-tier Emporio Armani line, with only a distinct lack of violet leaf or cardamom making any difference between them both. It's as if they decided \"oh this did well in our executive brand, so let's try it with the standard line too\" in the most cash-grubbing way possible. The only real redemption here is Alberto Morillas knows his way around a commercial piss take, as he's made a career out of composing them in between actual strokes of genius. I'm almost certain this rides on the coattails of scents like Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013) and Azzaro Wanted (2016), it really just does nothing to stand on its own two legs outside of sharing that commonality with other scents in this style, making it a \"me too\" scent in the magnitude of some 80's and 90's Avon masculines, just with a higher budget.\n\r\nThe smell of Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu is instantly recognizable as the same kind of \"fresh, sweet, and warm all at once\" opening that is so pervasive in 2010's masculine perfumery, as if they're trying to lean back towards the unisex styles of the late 90's and early 2000's but without the funky fruity ozonic pizazz of the era. It's a defanged dynamic fruit accord which resembles not a smidgen of classic Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Pour Homme outside the marine dihydromyrcenol, with the bergamot of Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Profumo making a return. The \"fruity notes\" here I just refer to as a \"pectin\" note because pectin has no real flavor of its own but adds fruity body to whatever you dump it in, which is what this aromachemical basically does for Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu. I'm thinking some descendant of calone 1951 is to blame, but I am no chemist so I can't be sure. The rest of the scent goes from the geranium rosemary barbershop vibe of Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Profumo, adding French lavender to replace the clary sage so the scent feels rounder and softer. The base is right in Stronger With You territory, and is almost copy/paste chesnut, vanilla, ambroxan, and norlimbanol, with patchouli, tonka, and labdanum added to smooth the edges and blur the lines a bit more. Stronger With You wants to still be considered an oriental, while this toys with even having a genre at all, which are the key differences. Wear time is nice and long because this is an eau de parfum, but sillage is actually very quiet, which is one saving grace since usually anything loaded with ambroxan or norlimbanol radiates like a cloud around the wearer. I guess this is a romantic take on the Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Pour Homme formula due to the sweetness, but it does little to resemble the original entry besides share an aquatic note and packaging motif.\n\r\nI don't hate Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu, but neither do I see this necessary in a modern wardrobe already stocked with the likes of older (and far better) examples of the 2010's \"fresh amberwoods\" style. If you already own Bleu de Chanel (2010), Prada Luna Rossa (2012), Versace Eros (2013), Dior Sauvage (2015), Gentleman Givenchy (2017), or Coach for Men (2017), your bases are more than covered already and this is a redundant purchase for you. Furthermore, if you love Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Pour Homme, and particularly enjoyed the Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Profumo (or even Essenza) flankers, you will NOT like this at all because it really is just \"emperor's new clothes\" in an Acqua di Gi\u00f2 bottle. The best part of this scent is the smooth clear glass and wood cap that adorns it, etched with a stylized logo, and not the scent itself. If you have a raging love affair with this style, maybe Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu is for you, and honestly it isn't terrible, nor offensive in any way, being a simple stupid grab for the guy who really doesn't actually care what he smells like so long as he smells pleasant. I'd stay away from summer use on this, which is the only instance it could be cloying due to the sweetness, and obviously this is too bland for anything more sophisticated than a night at the mall, so keep Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Profumo for the formal occasions. I do see some club-worthiness with Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu, and maybe that's the intended marketing angle with it, but I'm just so indifferent about where this fits that it's a stretch of the imagination. Easily a neutral for me, but like I always say, go see for yourself before making any premature conclusions as your thoughts may vary. ",

			"content": "Tried Acqua di Gio Absolu at a local Lord & Taylor way back in February. The tester had listed the fragrance notes as: \"Marine Notes - Patchouli - Labdanum.\" I went ahead and sprayed a LOT of this new scent on the back of my hand, and I went ahead and noted how this potion evolved on my skin throughout the day.\n\r\nOpening is very restrained, on a skinscent level. I smelled a definite marine note, reminscent of sea salt and ocean. There is a general presence of fruitiness, not pointing to anything specifically, kind of a fruitbowl filled with grapes and citrus. The DNA of the original Acqua di Gio is not perceivable in this mix, but rather this one smells like the result of repeatedly distilling the original and ending up with a ghostly echo forging its own path. \n\r\nThe heart unfurls like a curtain and starts to open up and reveal the spices within: Lavender, geranium, and rosemary definitely pop out and speak their peace. Ahh, maybe this will start to rise above skinscent level and increase in sillage; but not at all, it feels like it's being held in check by some invisible barrier, keeping the fragrance laid back even still. I really want it to blossom into something similar to the original, but....\n\r\n....the resultant homestretch quality is akin to the Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb fragrance, and ending up smelling like what I call the \"modern melange\" of typical scents like Paco Rabanne 1 Million & Invictus, Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo, YSL \"Y\" + L'Homme Ultime, Armani Stronger With You, etc. etc. Disappointing, as I expected more from this gorgeous-looking EdP.\n\r\nMaybe this is Armani's way to put its hat into the \"modern melange\" type of similar scents that seem to be ubiquitous now. In the end, I much prefer all of the other prior AdG versions - original, Essenza, Profumo, and Profumo Special Blend - than this one. I WANTED to really like this one, but in the final estimation I think it's an okay, albeit overhyped, Armani scent worthy of test spritzes and decants - but you be the judge.",

			"content": "If I didn't know the name of this fragrance I would never have thought it was part of the Acqua di Gio family. While there may be a slight resemblance in some aspects of the woody dry down, there is very little familiar AdG DNA in Absolu. In fact, it seems like it would be better suited as a flanker in the Stronger With You line, let's say a summer version or eau fraiche. That's not a knock against Absolu necessarily, just a comment pertaining to where it fits in and what you can expect before buying it.\n\r\nAbsolu opens with a tart and fruity bergamot accord--fresh, sweet, and sort of similar to that found in recent releases like Azzaro Wanted and Dior Sauvage. It goes on somewhere in the middle between scratchy-synthetic and smooth. And it's in the opening 15 or 20 minutes that it reminds me most of Azzaro Wanted with this kind of chemical, tart fruitiness that's a bit harsh, vaguely fresh and mildly sweet. However, it really becomes pleasant after 20 minutes or so and feels much more smooth and polished once it settles in (definitely smoother and less brash than Wanted). The fruity bergamot takes on a bright clarity and vibrancy, and develops more of a distinct, unique smell. This accord takes command of the scent, but it's also supported by a mildly sweet and subtle powdery quality via lavender and tonka bean, which fills out the base and gives it a bit of a sensual edge. So just to be clear, Absolu is not just a \"fruity\" scent, as in a bunch of fruit notes supported by some half-assed woods and white musk or something like that. While it features a fruity accord that drives it, a good portion of Absolu still consists of other, non-fruity elements which add this dimension of a sweet, aromatic, powdered base. In this sense it's a complete fragrance, albeit somewhat linear. Absolu doesn't change much throughout its duration, mostly it's just the intensity of the fruity bergamot accord which increases intensity and gradually decreases.\n\r\nDoes it smell nice? Yes. Does it smell familiar? Somewhat. Absolu is pretty indicative of modern men's perfumery, which lately consists of a lot of semi-sweet, fresh aroma chemicals, well-blended and creating something vaguely fruity and sort of clean, with a touch of sensuality to boot. But at least here it's well done, and serves as a more appealing example of this style. If you already own several scents like this, you may find it a little redundant, but if you appreciate and enjoy this style, then you'll surely like Absolu as well. I don't get a lot of aquatic sea notes in this. Unless I'm missing them, I don't think it's particularly watery, especially to the extent that the other AdG offerings are. Performance is above average, lasting a solid 8 hours with medium projection, reaching about two or three feet off the skin at its peak, and probably sitting about a foot off the skin the majority of the time. Absolu has a semi-casual sort of appeal, crossing the boundaries between romantic, sporty, and office wear. In other words, it's pretty versatile. While it's not the most groundbreaking scent, it's well-done. Smooth, tightly constructed, and possessing a nice, bright vibrancy, Absolu gets a thumbs up and a final 8.5 out of 10 rating. Recommended for sampling.",

Rosemary adds the rough spice note as it leads you into the base notes of Rock Rose and Tonka Bean. The \"woody\" note(s) I think may be Cedarwood & Sandalwood...subtle and not heavy-handed.

Comparisons to Green Irish Tweed should stop at the word \"Green.\" There's a faint mandarin note in the beginning, followed by soft, pale florals (rose? jasmine?) and the emergence of a very green galbanum. The galbanum accord is interesting; it's bitterly verdant and also kind of oddly sweet. This note is strongest in the second half of Viper's development and it's my favorite aspect of the composition. I'm not familiar with a lot of female perfumes, so judging this one from that perspective is impossible for me to do. However, as a man, this is not something I enjoyed wearing at all. There were also times when it reminded me of Glade air freshener (the kind you keep in a spray can next to the toilet). So I wouldn't even say that this feels worth the price, regardless of your gender. It's not bad, but quality wise there isn't much about it that really stands out. I found Ex-Nihilo's Fleur Narcotique a much more satisfying floral (that men could pull off well). Since I just gave it a brief wearing one day, and I really think it's meant for women, I'm going to hold off on a numerical rating, and just say that for me, it gets a thumbs down.  5/10\n\r\nSide note: While I'm able to articulate fragrances with some vocabulary and jargon related to the field, sometimes it's best to trust those who can't: The other day I sprayed some Viper Green on my arm while my wife was out running errands.

			"content": "The 2018 version of Eau de Givenchy is a quite straightforward eau de cologne on my skin, with a slightly more pronounced feminine touch of tender floral and cottony musk.\n\r\nThe first 3 hours of Eau de Givenchy is dominated by the refreshingly bitter green petit grain and its more floral cousin, the verdant neroli. The orange blossom provides a suave, faintly indolic backdrop, while the various citrus fruits only briefly offer a few glimpses at the very first moment. With Eau de Givenchy focusing more on the petit grain-neroli-orange blossom trio instead of sparkling citrus fruits or Mediterranean aromatic herbs, the fragrance leans more traditionally feminine to my nose. \n\r\nIts focus on neroli and its cousins also reminds me of Tom Ford Neroli Portofino and Frederic Malle Cologne Ind\u00e9l\u00e9bile. However, while they're interchangeable to a certain extent, Eau de Givenchy differs more significantly in the dry down, with its more substantial, cotton-y yet slightly metallic musk adding more heft and rendering it more opaque comparing to the sharper, leaner, soapier and somewhat more \"robotic\" Neroli Portofino, or the more refined and traditional Cologne Ind\u00e9l\u00e9bile. Although I haven't yet compared them side by side, the prominently musky dry down of Eau de Givenchy is reminiscent of that of Byredo Blanche's to my nose, more than other eau de cologne-type of fragrances.\n\r\nThe sillage of Eau de Givenchy is moderate to soft, while the longevity is at least 8 hours on me.\n\r\nAs I haven't yet had the opportunity to smell the original Eau de Givenchy, I don't have any direct comparison to offer. But there's no doubt that this brand new version of Eau de Givenchy smells like a product conceived to fit and made in our modern era, rather than one trying to convey vintage characteristics. \n\r\nWithout prior knowledge of the original version, I find this 2018's Eau de Givenchy an adequate eau de cologne-style fragrance, centred around green neroli and vaporous, clean white musk, and marginally more feminine than most colognes. Although arguably less polished and less nuanced than many neroli-white musk fragrances put out by well-known niche brands, the price and the accessibility of Eau de Givenchy nevertheless put it at a relative advantage. I'd recommend it as a gateway clean neroli-white musk perfume from mainstream designer brands.",

So I didn\u2019t know what anyone was saying about it, good or bad. And when I ordered a bottle of it the only thing I knew was that some people were saying it was like Spicebomb and that other people were arguing with them and denying any connection to the Viktor & Rolf smash-hit. But I like Spicebomb so I figured at the least, I\u2019d like this, and if it was different, then I\u2019d have something new. Well, now that I\u2019ve had Rehab for a couple of months, I think the best way to describe is like this: Rehab is a much smoother, richer, creamier, more polished and overall much better version of Spicebomb. It\u2019s also whiter and airier, more aromatic, and less spicy. But the central accord which drives each is very similar in terms of their basic smell. Still, I love that smell, and will gladly pay more for what is absolutely the best version of it I\u2019ve e countered so far. And, as is the case with 1899, RehAb is only similar to Spicebomb for so long. Once it hits the dry down stage it really takes on a very different character altogether, here becoming much more about lavender, a creamy sandalwood, and an excellent aromatic tobacco. It projects extremely well and lasts a long time. Rehab\u2019s become one of my favorites, with its upbeat, friendly aroma an excellent choice for casual wear and for socializing. No need to complicate this review by saying much else. It\u2019s a great fragrance, even if the first hour or two are a bit familiar. Final rating: 9/10",

Apart from it standing out like a bride with its white bottle and box, the scent is noticeably the most agreeable among the lot which includes many single-note concept fragrances based on inspirations like ambergris that are generally more challenging.\n\r\nRather, Rehab takes a fresh spicy approach that blends tobacco with a fresh opening of citrus and lavender followed by a dry down of woods, patchouli, and vetiver, with some general spiciness of something like pepper all throughout, almost like a white/black pepper that reminds me of Lalique White or Armani Prive New York.\n\r\nIt's spicy yet fresh, sharp yet sort of smooth and comforting to wear.  It's a weird contradiction, but a fun wear and one that I quite like to try on.  It's also almost borderline clean; there's something oddly clean about it, as pepper has that sort of effect on fragrances for me sometimes when mixed with the other correct contributors.\n\r\nThe scent is said by many to mimic Spicebomb (or the Fresh or Extreme flankers, even) by Viktor & Rolf but I don't get that, really, at least initially, though perhaps a side-by-side is warranted.\n\r\nThe juice is pricier than most of Initio, even, albeit at a higher concentration: $330 for 90ml extrait, while most of the house\u2019s offerings are EDP.\n\r\nIts performance is very good, though, certainly reasonable while not being exceptional for the type of scent it is.  Overall, it's a darn good scent but its pricing just exceeds its ingenuity.  At a more modest price, a fraction of its retail price, it'd be one I'd consider buying.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

To me, this smells like a highly, stridently-synthetic and sharply-ambered version of Cuir Ottoman (on a REALLY bad day). Cold, bitterly pungent, plastic-y, and artificially harsh are some of the descriptors that come to mind when I spray this on. I find nothing redeeming in this fragrance and I'm sad to think this is how modern noses interpret the glorious and (normally) varied smell of \"leather.\"",

The accord is moderately satisfying, but is too meek, and doesn't hold up well for long on my skin - it fades in about a couple of hours. It is linear, in the usual Tom Ford style. Stylistically it is in the same vein as Tuscan Leather or Acqua di Parma Colonia Leather, but those two are much superior. \n\r\nThis is the same as Ombre Leather 16 to my nose. Honestly it seems that much of the fanfare about this fragrance is because it is the same as Ombre Leather 16 (a diluted spin on Tuscan Leather, and Tuscan Leather is too strong for some) at about two-thirds of the price. There are dozens of better leather perfumes at lower prices, including the Acqua di Parma which can be had for less. \n\r\n2.5/5",

There are aspects of his fragrances that really draw me to them, and I hold out faith that his aesthetic of refinement could ultimately lead me to something substantial in my collection. Then there is the part of me that wonders why I keep setting high expectations for fragrances that rarely last more than 5 hours on my skin, which is once again the case for Ombre Leather.\n\r\nThe floral notes are well done, softening the stringent synthetic blast of leather on first use: not altogether unlike Tuscan Leather but without as much raspberry and a good deal more cardamom. The leather scent is strong-a cold and methodical leather. Drydown is straightforward, becoming a soft, spicy leather as the hours progress. Not many hours, however: it becomes a skin scent after 4-5 hours. As usual. I would squarely put this fragrance in the realm of unisex.\n\r\nI enjoy it more than Tuscan Leather, I'll say that. If the drydown was more interesting and there was more depth this may be a thumbs up, as you'd be getting something quite interesting for a brief period of time. It's a fine scent, the below average longevity and sillage again make question how many more times I'm going to spend this much money to get disappointed.\n\r\n6/10",

The best way I could describe this would be for you to go to a Nordstrom/Saks, etc., grab a nice captoe, maybe Allen Edmonds or Ferragamo, from the men's shoe department, walk towards the fragrance department, stand about twenty feet from a fragrance counter where the various perfumes can be smelled in the air, and then bury your face into the shoe and take a big whiff.  This smells like the midway point between the men's shoes section and the fragrance counters.  That's the best way that I can put Ombre Leather into an experiential description.\n\r\nThat said, I like it.  I'm not sure if others would enjoy smelling it on my person, but I just dig it.  I love the smell of good shoe leather, and this is a solid representation of it.  I'm also not sure what situation I'd be in where I would want to wear this or where it would be appropriate, but I do know that it needs to be autumn/winter to pull this one off.\n\r\nThumbs up on this quirky number!",

To the many, this has been successful too, but in terms of fragrance, a disappointment to say the least.\n\r\nHaving only really owned one or two of his scents (Sahara Noir being by far my favourite of all, which is since discontinued), Ombre Leather comes as a welcome addition. Better still, it is not part of the private range.\n\r\nIt isn't hard to see what TF is trying to achieve here. Ombre Leather is a go-between Black Orchid and Tuscan Leather, with a deliberate appeal to both men and women thrown in. The use of nagarmotha is clearly toned-down here, compared to say, Black Orchid. This is welcome and makes this a controversial leather: it's by no means a traditional castorium-based leather. Instead, the black truffle notes of Black Orchid are apparent, as is TF's distinctive patchouli and jasmine accord. I particularly like the jasmine aspect.\n\r\nThe florals give it an added twist of femininity, whilst still holding true to the unisex badge. In fact, this part makes it quite alluring, yet sensual too. The concept of florals and leather is nothing new mind you: from Chanel's Antaeus in the early 80s to Acqua di Parma's more recent Colonia Leather from the Ingredient Collection, the idea has been hanging around for a while.\n\r\nOmbre Leather maintains a long lasting trail well into the evening and this should be taken into account by the wearer. Projection is also quite strong. It's also worth noting that this is a \"smell me from a distance\" type of scent. Up close, it can be overpowering.\n\r\nFinally, the bottle really fits the scent's overall theme quite well, making this a great addition to the 2018 line-up.",

			"content": "This will truly test a fan of leather fragrances. Ombr\u00e9 Leather (2018) looks to be a retooling of Ombr\u00e9 Leather 16 (2016), which itself was part of the Private Blends, while this entry is not. Ombr\u00e9 Leather kind of sits between the Signature Collection and the Private Blends line price-wise, as denoted by it's strange bottle which is plain like the Private Blend decanters but not squared off. Ombr\u00e9 Leather is a rather simple and straightforward affair, being the smell of black shoe and handbag leather right up front, with little else to get in the way. I'm not sure if Sonia Constant also composed this, but like the erstwhile Ombr\u00e9 Leather 16, this version plays with cardamom and patchouli as support players, but unlike the previous Private Blends iteration, doesn't feel like a toned-down feminine-aimed version of Tuscan Leather (2007). The new Ombr\u00e9 Leather wants to hang in the same wheelhouse as Knize Ten (1924), Dior Fahrenheit (1988), Ted Lapidus Pour Homme (1978), and vintage English Leather (1949) in terms of it's sheer petroleum-tanned nakedness, but it's still not as intense in the drydown.\n\r\nOmbr\u00e9 Leather opens with that massive black shoepolish leather front and center, playing with a drop of jasmine indole and violet leaf to keep it focused in your mind. Cardamom comes into the middle along with patchouli to round and sweeten the deal enough so that it doesn't burn the nostrils like old English Leather can, sitting right between top and middle for the first few hours. The starring leather note very slowly fades, much slower than in Ombr\u00e9 Leather 16, keeping greater sillage as a result, and leaning fairly unisex, even if most heteronormative ladies wouldn't wear something that screams \"Dominatrix\" quite like this outside the bedroom. An old-school composite amber note (not ambroxan) joins a fancy new \"fractured\" oakmoss note free of it's allergens, first toyed with by Theirry Wasser of Guerlain for unreleased reforms of their classics, but now in Ombr\u00e9 Leather to give it a mild, if surprising moss bite at the end. The moss is still dialed way down for modern tastes, so vintage heads don't get too excited, but it's here. Overall, this smells like a shoe, as I first said in the beginning of the review, Ombr\u00e9 Leather will test a true leather fan's constitution from beginning to end.\n\r\nI think the same level of notoriety and shock value as Tom Ford Black Orchid (2006) has the same potential to arise here in time with the right marketing. The idea of smelling like a cobbler or the gear one wears to a BDSM gathering can be both frightening and oddly alluring all at once. I don't know when you might find it appropriate to wear this, because most masculine-leaning leathers are flanked with herbal or booze notes while feminine ones have floral and fruity supporting players, unless we're talking the 70's and 80's, where everything from soapy orris to a \"barrel note\" was added. In this situation, I don't think Tom Ford was looking to emulate a specific era of fragrance as he is often wont to do, but rather just delivered an uncompromising one-off scent, oddly based on something from another line of his but brought down into slightly more-accessible territory price-wise, which is another odd facet about it. Tom Ford quirkiness never seems to disappoint, and even if this ends up in the same pop culture trash can as Fucking Fabulous (2017), at least it's a Hell of a sight more wearable. Definitely sample first and keep this to winter use if you decide to take it home, because Ombr\u00e9 Leather ain't messin' around no way no how.",

			"content": "After last year\u2019s Bourreau des Fleurs, Serge Lutens seems to continue his olfactory exploration of immortelle with this year\u2019s L\u2019Innommable.\n\r\nThe fragrance opens with delicious dried stone fruits. Apricots, plums and peaches are carefully dried under the sun, then spiced up by cumin, piquant but not necessarily sweaty. A few drops of honey and caramel drip from the immortelle and benzoin onto the dried fruits, just enough to complement their sweet flavour without thickening the texture. Finally, a pinch of salt rounds everything up, amping up the gourmand sensation without leveling up the sweetness.\n\r\nThis kind of spicy dried fruits appearing rather frequently in Lutens\u2019 compositions, it\u2019s now widely regarded as one of his olfactory signatures. As a result, L\u2019Innommable instantly pops a few names into my head: Arabie, El Attarine and the aforementioned Bourreau des Fleurs. I didn\u2019t compare them side by side, but from my memory, I\u2019d say the spices, especially the cumin, play a much stronger role and are overall sharper in Arabie than in L\u2019Innommable, while Bourreau des Fleurs feels more caramel-y. El Attarine has the least fruity elements out of these four, but its emphasis on honeyed caramel-cumin duality of immortelle combined with a certain dense animalic muskiness makes it closer to L\u2019Innommable in the dry down.\n\r\nTo be clear, L\u2019Innommable doesn\u2019t have the same muskiness as El Attarine, but it achieves a similar effect via the intermediate of something reminiscent of tuberose and sandalwood. The tuberose is not at all camphorated or diffusively sweet or creamy, but somehow is bent inward and rendered densely nutty by the sandalwood-like nuance. These two emerge from underneath about 1 hour in, lending the dried fruits a surprisingly leathery touch. The combined effect is not dissimilar to the leathery immortelle-tuberose of Histoires de Parfums Tub\u00e9reuse 3 Animale.\n\r\nL\u2019Innommable then stays more or less the same until the end, with occasion woody smokes sizzle through the musky tuberose and leathery dried fruits. The sillage is relatively close with an 8-hour longevity on a hot day. \n\r\nOverall, I quite enjoy L\u2019Innommable, especially its leathery and musky tuberose twist on the immortelle and his signature spicy dried fruits. However, the fact that it reminds me of several other fragrances does make me pause. Granted, its price, while high-end, is not the most outrageous in that category. But it doesn\u2019t seem as efficient as other more reasonably priced immortelle or immortelle-tuberose fragrances, either. Personally, I\u2019d be more excited if it was released in the regular range, but if you happen to be exploring immortelle in perfumery, it would be interesting to sample too.\n",

Overall, it reminds me of the Brut I splashed on after shaving earlier, though smelling of a completely different class of quality. Nicely blended, and I would almost hazard to say subtle for a fougere and for Tom Ford fragrances I've tried in general. It seems like many times that less potent \"jump\" from the opening in parfums leads to increased longevity, but that is sadly not the case for me here. Granted, I did not moisturize before sampling, but this settled to a skin scent surprisingly quick, and morphs into its final stage in about an hour. Here it is a vaguely woody with a very faint hint of labdanum, but I really have to bury my nose in here to pick it up. An updated version of a classic scent. To me, this is to Brut what Viking is to Old Spice. I like the scent, and an updated fougere would be an awesome thing to have this day and age, but the performance here is just bad.

			"content": "Foug\u00e8re d'Argent (2018) is the first foug\u00e8re entry in the Private Blends collection that is explicitly described as such. This is also likely the first time the 'ol foug\u00e8re category has seen any sort of prestige release from a perfumer since Parfums MDCI released Invasion Barbare (2005) to both critical acclaim and backlash (depending on the size of the person's wallet doing the critique). Foug\u00e8re d'Argent doesn't seem to go after that \"I drive a leased Rolls Royce when I could have bought a BMW\" segment of men who see Patrick Batemann from American Psycho as some sort of hero instead of the twisted product of society that he is, but instead aims for the guy that loves his Rive Gauche Pour Homme (2003) and wishes Tom Ford never left LVMH. Well, just in the same way that Tom Ford for Men (2007) was the idea for Gucci Pour Homme (2003) cannibalized, re-purposed and taken upmarket, Foug\u00e8re d'Argent feels like the concept for Rive Gauche Pour Homme updated with modern IFRA-compliant materials and a few new twists to the foug\u00e8re story. Sadly, we don't know what nose created this for ol' Mr. Ford, but the overall effect of Foug\u00e8re d'Argent is a richer, slightly sweeter, and more decadent foug\u00e8re that can hold up to nightlife, romantic use, but also come out swinging in the 9 to 5 day at the office due to it's parfum strength, especially if you crashed at your date's house the night before and can't shower. I quite like what was done here, and although as a Private Blend it is a bit more pricey than the usual Tom Ford signature fragrance, it actually feels more at home with them in style than among it's own kind. I'd almost wave the usual niche sample-first warning with this one because it's so \"in the pocket\" as far as foug\u00e8res go, but I also can't speak for everyone else, and it's easy enough to find at a department store to try.\n\r\nFoug\u00e8re d'Argent opens with mandarin orange, a smidge of bergamot, sweet French lavender and ginger. This one really flirts with being an oriental but stays the foug\u00e8re course thanks to the dominant lavender in the mix. The opening isn't really what draws Rive Gauche Pour Homme comparisons, as at this stage it just feels like a spiced up 80's foug\u00e8re with it's soapy orris and smoky vetiver switched out for the mandarin orange and ginger, like Calvin Klein Obsession for Men (1986) got in on with the later Calvin Klein Eternity for Men (1989), and this is the child resultant. Going forward, clove, cistus labadanum, and a newcomer called agikalawood make an appearance. Keep your eyes on that last one kids, because if it takes off in this foug\u00e8re, it could set off a chain reaction that sees another foug\u00e8re era with every major designer from $200 a bottle down to $20 (including Avon) making their own moss-free foug\u00e8re with either real agiklawood or some chemical proxy leading the charge. I still think this genre is not complete without oakmoss, but unless more designers take a cue from artisinal perfumers and tell IFRA to shove off, it ain't happening. Agikalawood is a bit sweeter, since it is related to the patchouli plant, but it does have a smidgen of the dank buttery heft real oakmoss contains, and is a sure sight better than whatever else is going into reformulations of classics these days. The base is of course going to be coumarin, musk, and amber, because what memorable foug\u00e8re doesn't have at least two of those? Foug\u00e8re d'Argent is still a little lighter and sweeter than Rive Gauche Pour Homme by the end of it's wear, but is closest by this point and a far sight more masculine than any of the late 80's and early 90's \"fresh foug\u00e8res\" that plagued the designer realm. Foug\u00e8re d'Argent dries down to a tonka note laced with musk, spices and ginger, and glimpses of the lavender, clove, and citrus resurfacing depending on the way air hits skin. The akigalawood doesn't really have a unique trail all it's own, but that's probably not why it's there. \n\r\nI feel this could have been a signature line scent and was only placed in the Private Blends collection because it's ingredients are too expensive in the 21st century to warrant a designer price tag, since this stuff has the same equivalent performance, quality, and style of golden era masculines that vintage hounds fawn and fight over on eBay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know this is technically unisex like all Private Blends, but who are we kidding? This is the 1980's channeled through the revisionist style reminiscent of 2000's Tom Ford-led LVMH but produced by modern Tom Ford perfumers with a niche budget so it doesn't smell like the 135th reformulation butchery Proctor and Gamble has done to Old Spice (1937). I also really like how \"Foug\u00e8re\" is in the title of this one, like an even older throwback nod to the very first Foug\u00e8re Royale by Houbigant (1882), as if Tom Ford was trying to make a bookend to the genre, but that would imply he was done making foug\u00e8res, which is very unlikely given his track record for vintage-inspired masculines. The price may be a bit stiffer than some would like, but I'd certainly spend the money on this over the majority of what passes as \"prestige\" today, or even most of what Tom Ford pumps out in the Private Blends. There are definitely better examples in this category, but literally all of them are in the past, so with that in mind, I welcome this as a \"where there's a will, there's a way\" example of keeping traditional perfume designs alive for the future, and it's a damn good barbershop scent to boot. As one of the rare few examples of a romantic Foug\u00e8re, I'd keep this to night time use and chill weather, but considering the cost, you can do whatever you want with it if you buy a full bottle. Foug\u00e8re d'Argent is a parfum, and has plenty of oomph, so don't go trigger-happy like you might normally with a scent of this type, or you might find yourself without a date after too long. ",

This is branded unisex by virtue of its inclusion in the Private Blend line, but even a deviation from the traditional fougere rings masculine.\n\r\nPerformance is solid, reflective of the price and that, genre-wise, Fougere d'Argent is year-round-friendly and while I regard it as more of a daytime option, it can certainly suit someone at night, and surely for formal scenarios as well.\n\r\nThe lower end of the Private Blend pricing is now up to $235 for 50ml as evidenced by this new release and its sibling, Fougere Palatine, so this is wholly in the category of \"need to love it in order to buy a full bottle\" and even with one wearing, I expect Tom Ford has won me over with the innovation and versatility of the fragrance, but more wearings of my decants will follow.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

			"content": "Foug\u00e8re Platine (2018) feels like a lost release since Foug\u00e8re d'Argent (2018) gets all of the attention at the moment, but people forget that this one also released alongside it, just with less distribution for some reason. Maybe Foug\u00e8re Platine is to Foug\u00e8re d'Argent what Halston 112 (1976) is to Halston Z-14 (1976), an alternate formula for the same scent which Tom Ford also liked and wanted to see released under a different designation just like Roy Halston Frowick, with less advertising glitz to go around. Foug\u00e8re d'Argent gets more than it's fair share of comparisons to the Tom Ford-overseen YSL Rive Gauche Pour Homme (2003), but Foug\u00e8re Platine doesn't have such a tall historical comparison it has live up to, and just sits by itself quietly, waiting to be tried by the curious. One thing I can say right away, is that Foug\u00e8re Platine doesn't go in the barbershop direction with the same conviction as Foug\u00e8re d'Argent, and doesn't have a starring exotic note like Akigala wood to grab everyone's attention to it. Instead, we get a basic green aromatic near-foug\u00e8re with it's oakmoss switched out for norlimbanol and tobacco, giving the stuff an earthy and sharp finish that makes it a modern take on the \"beards and cardigan sweaters\" style of mid-70's foug\u00e8re craft. Is it good? Well, if you can stomach \"karmawood\" it is (and many of the old fragheads cannot), so Foug\u00e8re d'Argent is likely to be your cup of tea if the answer to that question is no, while Foug\u00e8re Platine goes more for the less-than-perfect \"Hollywood romanticized\" look of the 70's rather than a tit-for-tat recreation of the barbershop. Foug\u00e8re Platine also feels more original to me because it's not so deliberately derivative as it's popular sibling. \n\r\nFoug\u00e8re Platine opens with bergamot and clary sage, two very standard and distinctly recognizable dry accords found in the genre. There is a spec of something green, but it's not grassy like the 70's staple of galbanum, so it's likely a vetiver note turned way down, with a round French lavender coming in a moment later. This lavender hooks up with the sage to be the star of the show for the first hour until bitter artemisia shows up to take us back in a dry direction, adding a little dustiness that removes us from any semblance of barbershop once and for all. An incense note shows up next, the result of the frankincense-derived olibanum, which makes the transition to the karmawood base more bearable because norlimbanol is smoothed of it's scratchiness a bit by olibanum, as evidenced in scents like Amouage Jubilation XXV (2008). Crisp cedar and a nice leafy tobacco join the karmawood, giving me impressions of something like a modernized Aramis Havana (1994) or to a lesser extent Jean-Louis Vermeil for Men (1997), but the foug\u00e8re top which lingers around keeps any more than a trace comparison from being made. At the skin, Foug\u00e8re Platine is tobacco, synthetic woods, wisps of artemisia and the sage top. The finish is palatial, gentlemanly, semi-dry and quiet, something it shares with Halston 112. I'd say this is really less like a foug\u00e8re than Foug\u00e8re d'Argent, even if it's structure is actually more traditionally foug\u00e8re-like through all but the base. What's in a name anyway? Sillage is surprisingly quiet after an hour, but like most Tom Ford Private Blend creations, this will linger on skin for hours and hours. I'd keep this to office use, as it's pretty devoid of sensuality unless your date partner likes a good tobacco smell on skin. \n\r\nI don't see Foug\u00e8re Platine getting the attention or sales of Foug\u00e8re d'Argent. Without trying to intentionally doom the new darling addition to the lineup, I don't really see production lasting all that long either, with this eventually joining the Private Blend afterlife alongside Moss Breches (2007) and Arabian Wood (2009), to be called favorite and best Private Blend by those Basenoters that won't let themselves like something until it's discontinued then sing it's praises and hoard it with a level of hysteria I still can't wrap my head around. Anyways, I could be wrong and this lingers far longer than expected, like the still-popular Oud Wood (2007) with it's Comet Cleanser scratch in the base. I'd gladly take Foug\u00e8re Platine over that, but I also quite like a nicely done tobacco, even in an experimental near-foug\u00e8re like this. Asking price is typical for a TF Private Blend, so that means sample sample sample, but if you like it's green and not-so-mean stateliness, there are definitely worse things you could buy with that same amount of cash. As for me? I give it a thumbs up for a rarely-seen aromatic foug\u00e8re style in the 21st century, in yet another Tom Ford attempt to make what is old new again, but with such a large stock of vintage masculines both still produced or discontinued but plentiful, I don't really see this as an alternative to anything I can't or don't already have. I hope this \"Foug\u00e8re X\" series continues, I rather like where Tom Ford's head is with these things. ",

After several odd fresh and floral releases, he has returned to his old style of eastern spices and resins. \n\r\nPP smells good, I'll give it that. But it's now a well-played tune. Immortelle, pine, spice. That pretty much sums it up. If you want a comparison, mix the curried notes of Chypre Rouge with the coniferous notes of Fille en Aguiles, add a dash of Arabie, and there you have it. \n\r\nNot bad, but not terribly creative coming from Lutens at this point.

			"content": "Le Participe Pass\u00e9 opens with fresh mandarine surprisingly coated with tiny sparkles of aldehyde, reminiscent of the similar aldehydic opening of Laine de Verre and Dent de Lait, but of course much much softer in the case of Le Participe Pass\u00e9. \n\r\nThe fragrance is then swiftly dominated by resins, which I perceive mostly as benzoin and opoponax, surrounded by immortelle and over a slightly boozy woody undertone. They combine to form a soothing, suavely basamic woody smell, which is not unlike Lutens' own Ch\u00eane but Le Participe Pass\u00e9 is more resinous in comparison. There are occasional suggestions of caramel and chocolate but they never fully unleash their sweetness. Dried fruits are also hinted, but it smells more like the smooth leathery texture of dried date skin than stewed molasses.\n\r\nThere isn't much of any change once the fragrance settles into the smooth and comforting resinous woody dry down. The sillage is relatively soft, while the longevity is about 8 hours on a hot day.\n\r\nOn its own, I find Le Participe Pass\u00e9 very enjoyable and very fitting to Lutens' signature woody oriental style. But its ressemblance to Ch\u00eane leaves me conflicted. I love Ch\u00eane and the ressemblance itself is not necessarily problematic, it's that Le Participe Pass\u00e9 feels like a glossed version, with the interesting woody details covered up by sweet resins. While this makes Le Participe Pass\u00e9 more cozy, it loses some characters in return, and it's not like that Ch\u00eane was the more difficult or eccentric one among Lutens' offerings to begin with, which it certainly is not.\n\r\nBut still, its price and availability compared to Ch\u00eane is definitely an advantage. If you happen to be looking for a versatile, cozy, easy-to-wear woody balsamic fragrance, you may want to give Le Participe Pass\u00e9 a try.\n",

			"content": "Being a huge fan of most of the Hugo Boss Bottled #6 fragrances, I was more than happy to give this latest flanker a test.\n\r\nEven before my first spray, the scent was wafting out from the bottle and giving me a hint of things to come: Instead of the usual pungence of the apple-vanilla musk of the original and several key flankers, Boss Bottled United is an ethereal, aromatic foray into citrus peel and mint that is unlike expectations.  Iris is VERY subtle, adding a scintilla of its floral sweetness to this aromatic fragrance. The result is quite invogorating and pleasant, very accomodating for a casual outing in warmer weather.\n\r\nVetiver's green mossiness lends somewhat of a solidifying foundation, with a whiff of patchouli spiciness and slightly musky cashmeran. Overall, Boss Bottled United appears squarely designed for the summertime wearer, echoing Dior's Fahrenheit 32 in very parallel ways.\n\r\nInstead of the requisite tangy fruitiness I'm so fond of, this one takes a turn to smell more like one of the flankers of the Hugo series (e.g. Hugo Red, Hugo Just Different) than the Boss Bottled series.  That's not a bad thing, but it seems to reflect the end result that has nearly none of the #6's dna.\n\r\nI like this one.  It's a good, lighter alternative to Fahrenheit 32 (another light, a bit heavier though airy vetiver-orange fragrance suprisingly with vanilla which Bottled United lacks but the original #6 has).  There are a couple of the Boss Bottled flankers that I haven't tried admittedly, but my view is that this one tends to stand out as a decidedly different option among them all.  Worth a test and even a purchase, IMO.",

			"content": "Does it overstate the obvious to say that a Chanel perfume sparkles? The apocryphal stories of G. Chanel resisting scents that would cause a woman to smell simply floral seem to have continued to influence the contemporary additions to Chanel\u2019s line. 21st century Chanel isn\u2019t often well regarded among connoisseurs\u2019 conversations\u2014a nostalgia for older formulations pervades. But here\u2019s the thing: from my vantage, Chanel is fundamentally modern as a philosophy. The fashion, even biographical details of its initiator, eschew attachment, process loss, and revel in the aggressively new (think of Chanel\u2019s dispensing of busts and bustles, of her collaboration with the Ballets Russe). I opt to hold IFRA restrictions, reformulations, and even the seemingly greedy expansions of designer brands more as \u2018signs of the times\u2019 than grounds for the dystopian-point-of-no-return anxieties that color the analyses of more recently released Chanel fragrances. Read perfume as the temporal material that it is, with the semiotic ascriptions it might carry. \n\r\nSo No. 18 has some sparkle to it. It opens with worldly, metropolitan synthetics and aldehydes, closely followed by the cool-headed iris that Chanel cultivates in its own fields in Grasse. Chanel\u2019s iris proceeds gracefully through most of the perfumes designed for the house. No. 18 dresses up this plush, chilly iris with ambrette seed, one of those fascinating ingredients (originally harvested from plants, often synthesized nowadays) that somehow smells both of skin and soap. An enchanting \u2018white musk\u2019 quality pervades No. 18\u2019s opening. The modernism of the fragrance is its floralcy in an age of metal machines, its skin softness in ages of war, its artifice and chemistry with tenderness and heart. \n\r\nNo. 18 gradually sweetens on my skin, with the initially sharp intensity of its rose developing into something more unctuous and powdery. More than any other quality, the offhanded fruitiness that emerges marks the scent with the time when it was designed. My review is neutral not because there\u2019s anything particularly out of balance in No. 18, but because it lacks the assertiveness of its ingenious sisters, and ultimately seems mostly a remix of some of the most appealing, offbeat qualities of others in the line. It never dons the vintage cosmetics drag that 2016\u2019s Misia conjures, nor shimmers as much as several versions of Bois des Iles do; it shares some underlying rhythms with Nos. 5 and 19, but without the self-possession and oddity that only time and imitations have naturalized in those masterpieces. No. 18 is, by contrast, a procession of many of Chanel\u2019s most iconic accords, combined at very comfortable volumes. It behaves well as a sweetened skin scent, but its sparkle only lasts a fraction of its duration on my wrist. It\u2019s unsettling how it reveals the continuity that might be inferred between Nietzsche and Nordstrom. It offers the mainstream consumer an expensive simulacra of Chanel iconoclasm softened into an intentionally quotidian fixture of modern life.",

			"content": "Now this is an odd little number if I do say so myself. The story goes that this eau de parfum was conceived in 1997 for distribution in Chanel's boutique at 18 Place Vend\u00f4me, then re-conceived in 2007 as an eau de toilette for release as part of the Les Exclusifs line, then re-orchestrated a third time as an eau de parfum based on the eau de toilette version in 2016, all by Jacques Polge. The point of No. 18 (2016) is to be \"perfume jewelry\" reminiscent of the 18 Place Vend\u00f4me boutique after which it's named, but the reality of it is No. 18 is fragrance born of the constant re-envisioning that was Jacques Polge's hallmark as house perfumer for Chanel. Here's the thinking: Chanel Bois des \u00celes (1926) was an aldehyde perfume by Ernest Beaux focused on rose, sandalwood, vetiver, and musk ambrette. Jacques Polge wanted to make a masculine counterpart which lead to Bois Noir (1987), a fragrance that replaced aldehydes with citrus and banned musk ambrette with natural ambrette seed tones. This was brightened and slightly sweetened into \u00c9go\u00efste (1990) for a mass release, then various concentrations thereof followed. Polge obviously kept tinkering and pared down the formula even further, resulting in what we now have in No. 18: a feminine based on a masculine, based on another masculine, based on an old feminine by a previous house perfumer, full-circle. \n\r\nOnce you get passed the dizzying intertextuality No. 18 has with other past Chanels, you can get down to what it is: an elegantly simple representation of ambrette, rose, and iris. The entire musk mallow flower from which ambrette seed is derived is on display with No. 18, being dewy and green at first sniff, with traces of green tea in the opening, and a certain oily aspect to the opening, carried aloft by just a puff of bergamot. The iris and the rose comes next, the latter combining with the ambrette to give a huge connection to modern \u00c9go\u00efste, but made a bit more gentle with the iris. \u00c9go\u00efste already smelled rather unisex to my nose, and so does No. 18, especially since iris flower has been appearing more in masculines in place of the orris root component of the plant after the turn of the 21st century. There is supposedly a fruit note according to the published pyramid, but all I get after the heart is musk, and Polge's synthetic sandalwood compound that sees use in all modern iterations of Chanel perfumes calling for sandalwood. No vetiver, no detectable oakmoss, no oriental overtones like Bois des \u00celes, Bois Noir, or \u00c9go\u00efste. As a simple floral musk interpretation of the famed Chanel/Polge damask rose/sandalwood accord, No. 18 does exceptionally well, but is too fleeting for its price, with maybe 6 hours total performance coupled with close sillage. No. 18 also feels fairly context-neutral as well.\n\r\nBeing marketed to women willing to spend premium coin, No. 18 might be the answer for ladies in love with \u00c9go\u00efste but unwilling to cross the gender marketing lines to wear it (guys are more often a stickler about gender, but aren't always the only ones afraid to play with perfumes outside their marketing lane). Otherwise, this is just a lighter, puffier, shinier, and muskier presentation of the same accord as \u00c9go\u00efste to my nose, and that's not meant to be an insult. Guys who own \u00c9go\u00efste might find No. 18 a tad redundant unless they're total Chanel fanboys or looking for a warm weather alternative, especially at the $200-$350 price tag being asked for a 2.5 or 6.8 ounce bottle, respectively. Performance-per-dollar doesn't make this worth the price for me, but I'll stay a neutral vote and give it a thumbs up because it is very well-constructed and elegant to a fault, like most Chanel creations under Jaques Polge. Ambrette is also rarely the focus of a perfume since musk mallow faded from popularity and the demise of synthetic musk ambrette otherwise made the accord scarce, so Chanel gets kudos for that little bit of quirk too. Soft-spoken but well-done.",

Despite the listed bright / citrus notes of Bergamot, Mandarin, Grapefruit and Neroli, Century actually comes across almost immediately as a warm, slightly spicy wood / musk fragrance. Although not listed, I would say there is also a hint of sweet floral Iris note in the dry down. Overall, this is a very subtle scent, staying close to the skin, that feels very elegant and sophisticated. Possibly more suited to slightly cooler weather than hot sunny days\n\r\nInterestingly, I find this projects a very similar vibe to Le Labo\u2019s Santal 33 \u2013 both share common notes of Musk, Cardamom and Sandalwood. Cypriol (woody, earthy, spicy) is a close cousin for Santal 33\u2019s Papyrus note.

			"content": "Tituba was the Indian slave who belonged to Samuel Parris, the minister in whose household the witchcraft erupted; his daughter and niece were the first to convulse. Though likely a South American Indian, her origins are unclear. Those of color were almost never accused of witchcraft and English was clearly not her first language, but hers was the longest of all Salem testimonies. Tituba was specific and vague in her testimonies at the same time. Her accounts and revelations spread incredibly fast, so much like today's internet viral trends - many of the others accused used Tituba's phrases and accounts others adopted her words for their own or lavished more imagery on top of hers. \n\r\nSo to did her identity change and shift over time as the story of her was passed down. Tituba evolved over two centuries from Indian to half-Indian to half-black to black.  There is also no evidence she engaged in any voodoo. Tituba was put on trial after 15 months of imprisonment and the jury failed to indict her. The first to confess to signing a diabolical pact, she would be the last suspect released. She appears to have left Massachusetts with whoever paid her jail fees.\n\r\nTituba is a sweet, resinous perfume, which has a strong and well done beeswax/honey undertone. The spicy biscuits dominate in the opening and eventually falls away to a nice mild tobacco scent.  If you've ever rolled your own cigarettes or smelled a bundle of plain dried tobacco, it's that mild, toasted variety. The best part of Tituba is the beeswax/honey note which clings close to the skin giving it a sweet waxiness. \n\r\nTituba starts out strong, almost a gourmand perfume, and nicely eases it's way into that wonderful beeswax scent.

After a while the vanilla rose notes come in reminding me a bit of Tocade by Rochas.  \n\r\nThe smoky bits play into the 2nd act a bit more, but oh so creamy, sugary marzipan with that vanilla.  Gourmand is not my usual choice for perfumes but this one is worth a try. \n\r\nA bit of background on who Mercy Lewis was: Mercy Lewis was born in Falmouth, Maine in 1675. She was orphaned when both of her parents were killed in Indian attacks witnessed by Mercy herself. As a result, Mercy was sent to live with Reverend George Burroughs as his servant in Maine and then later to the household of Thomas Putnam in Salem Village. At the Putnam household, Lewis befriended Ann Putnam and her cousin Mary Walcott who were among the first to make claims of affliction resulting in accusations of witchcraft. To support their accusations, Mercy Lewis and the other girls continued to display \"evidence\" of affliction.\n\r\nAs an orphan, she had no money or dowry to offer in marriage, so the chances of obtaining a husband and thus escaping her social position of servitude must have seemed bleak. As Rev. John Hale noted in his Modest Inquiry, several of the \"afflicted\" Salem girls were anxious about their marriage prospects. Mercy Lewis was not involved in the initial accusations but rather joined Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, and Elizabeth Hubbard a little later in the game, it seems that perhaps a desperate need for social empowerment and belonging were strong, underlying motives. Mercy Lewis herself did not marry until late in life and then only after she had given birth to her first child.",

			"content": "Sixteen92 distinguishes itself as a line with a sort of good humored witchery that tempers a dedicated practice of the dark arts with candy-corn crone caricatures found populating Hallowe\u2019en decorations. Taking its name from the year that began the Salem witch trials, the collection celebrates and sends up magical and mythological ladies with scents like Baba Yaga and Tituba. Sixteen92\u2019s ethos is \u2018goth gourmand,\u2019 a phrase I first noted from San Francisco\u2019s Tigerlily Perfumery in their description of the West Coast\u2019s Ikiryo perfume house. Sixteen92\u2019s Claire Baxter exercises this \u2018goth gourmand\u2019 sensibility to memorable effect, along with her talented approach to conveying a sense of place in the shifts between notes in her fragrances. \n\r\nGrimm admirably displays Baxter\u2019s spatialized storytelling in scent, as well as her penchant for darkly dessert-redolent qualities. Hansel and Gretel ought to be forewarned of this concoction: it\u2019s delicious facets belie dank, forest depths. The scent delivers a beguiling rendition of immortelle\u2014that take-it-or-leave-it sweet stuff that can evoke curry, maple syrup, and richly aromatic straw. Grimm\u2019s immortelle is abetted by a cocoa note that huffs and sizzles. The pairing is a twisted patisserie haunted by Serge Lutens, particularly the cocoa in Santal Majuscule. Like the witch\u2019s confectionary domicile, the construction continues with a tobacco-tonka combo, rich and husky. \n\r\nWere that the extent of Grimm, it would be wickedly caramellic\u2014a comely sister of popular sugar bombs on the market. But that would be missing the vaster forest for the lollipop trees. It\u2019s the bed of murky, mossy undergrowth that offsets the delirium of chocolate-dipped helichrysum and cigars. Across four hours or so, Grimm settles into a potion of peaty, flat cola. Immortelle persists, but is found now among the underbrush. The candy implied earlier has gone up in smoke, and what remains shifts between wet and dry, eternal and entropic. There\u2019s just the right amount of patchouli-adjacent, hippy haze in the funk of this dry down.\n\r\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain. And no amount of magic will retrieve it from its melancholic fate. Grimm is ideal for kitchen witches on nature hikes, edible evil doers, goddesses, and bakers. Folkloric and forested, Grimm possesses a wit about the gourmand genre, casting the perfume into a narrative caught up in desire to eat and be eaten. ",

			"content": "The latest Imaginary Authors creation by Josh Meyer comes fittingly at summer, when a fragrance laden with neroli and a generally citrus-intensive element is apt to wear.\n\r\nI\u2019ve not been a fan of rhubarb previously but it\u2019s used in Sundrunk in what I can only describe as the right proportion, and, when mixed with neroli, the perfume reflects a superb balance between the freshness of the neroli and the tart, herbal qualities of rhubarb.  Orange zest adds a further sharp citrus edge without taking much attention away from the neroli or rhubarb, and frankly, I\u2019d have easily attributed any sharpness to the rhubarb itself in the absence of being shown orange zest on the note list.\n\r\nRose water and honeysuckle add further flavor, floral contributions that foster nuance and depth without taking over. Rose is among my favorite notes and in rose water, it\u2019s generally diluted thinly enough to be a rather fresh, semi-transparent addition. Honeysuckle is a note I\u2019m still learning to enjoy and have a difficult time detecting but in general, I quite like it and certainly approve of its use in Sundrunk.\n\r\nOverall, the experience of Sundrunk is great. Its harmonious citrus/floral entourage is sharp and tart but still refreshing, and deviates form the now-routine neroli takeover that we\u2019ve seen in abundance.\n\r\nI do wonder how Josh continues to find new and interesting formulas to create perfume when there is so much homogeneity in especially summer-friendly / fresh offerings nowadays.\n\r\nSundrunk\u2019s performance is decent, but certainly more in line with the more modestly-performing summer-friendly scents of recent years (Saint Julep, Every Storm a Serenade, and Mosaic are my favorites of these) than the heavier, more wintery offerings (my favorites being Cape Heartache, Memoirs of a Trespasser, and A City on Fire), and frankly, this should be expected given the note breakdown.\n\r\nI remain pleased with the price point, $95 for 50ml, as <$2/ml is sustainable for any offering that I like or especially that I love, though everyone\u2019s budget is different. That a travel size is now part of seemingly every new release, at $38 for 14ml, offers a viable alternative for those who need less and want to pay less. (I realize Whispered Myths has higher pricing but this is currently the lone exception)\n\r\nSundrunk works very well for me. It\u2019s a fragrance I want to smell over and over and it just about matches the achievement in innovation that was 2017\u2019s (pre-)summer release, Saint Julep. It\u2019ll be a welcome addition to my collection at some point.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

			"content": "Let's get one thing straight: this is not a designer attempt at Creed Aventus (2010), and the opening pineapple in this is way more direct like opening a can of Dole pineapples, than the erstwhile Creed. Now that we have that myth dispelled, what Coach Platinum (2018) represents to me is a take on the primary accord of the original Coach for Men (2017) without the suede leather element, burying what leather remains in a barbershop accord that is a bit more versatile but not as interesting. Make no mistake, Coach Platinum definitely is reminiscent to a minute degree of Creed Aventus, and perfumer Bruno Jovanovic may have had some desire to emulate a bit of that scent's overall aura, but it doesn't really translate into anything even close to the same style, and the cheapo clones available are still way closer to Aventus than this. Fans of Aventus that love the pineapple accord and want to experience it used differently without plunking down for an old bottle of Lapdius Pour Homme (1987) are actually in for a treat with Coach Platinum, as the pineapple here stays around during the entire wear and is the focus alongside juniper. The rest of the scent is simply a matter personal interpretation really, although the gaudy chrome-plated bottle may suggest an obsession with bling that most people who name drop Coach have anyway, so perhaps there is a bit of self-aware humor in this as well.\n\r\nThe opening of Coach Platinum is obviously that bright and juicy pineapple. The note stays and stays after this opening, with a bit of piquant black pepper keeping it from being juvenile until the juniper heart shows its face. The progression through the middle is very similar to Armani Code/Black Code (2004) with its dry sage and geranium usage, but this stays away from becoming too powdery by the small poof of leather in the base alongside the rest of the barbershop notes. Sandalwood and vanilla play a huge role in the development of the dry down, and impart Coach Platinum an oriental flair an hour into the wear, which compliments the sharp pineapple and juniper tandem accord. Unfortunately, the vanilla used in Coach Platinum is also of the hugely sweet and thick culinary kind (unlike Aventus), feeling like vanilla extract from the bottle before going into Grandma's pound cake, so this stuff can get cloying quick. This is especially true when the patchouli and musky cashmeran molecule kicks into overdrive near the final stages. If Aventus is smoky pineapples, then Coach Platinum is musky pineapples. Overall tone for Cocah Platinum is semi-casual and semi-romantic thanks to that fat bottom base, so I'd keep this way from austere office cubicle environments, but in more casual settings like the open floor plans of tech firms where jeans and t-shirt can be worn to work, this is totally fine. Wear time is literally all day and sillage is right in the medium zone thanks to the eau de parfum formulation, unless you wear this in summer or over-apply.\n\r\nI like Coach Platinum but will admit not caring for it nearly as much as Coach for Men, but the like is strong enough that I'd give this a thumbs up for fans of pineapple, juniper, and rich vanillic bases. Unlike Coach for Men, there is no obvious ambroxan molecule or scratchy norlimbanol a la Dior Sauvage (2015), but that doesn't mean the aromachemicals aren't there, just blended too deeply down into the oriental stew anchoring the soaring pineapple to the ground. Rich, semi-sharp, bright, and well-rounded are the best adjectives I can conjure for Coach Platinum, but being a perfume coming from the hands that crafted the notorious Ambercrombie & Fitch Fierce (2002), I'd expect no less than something attention-getting like this. The saving grace for Coach Platinum is the fact that it reconciles loud and youthful volume with a mature execution and sense of tradition. Coach Platinum is almost the \"office safe clubber\" in the sense that it has the presence but not the vulgar bombast outside of that potentially cloying vanilla. Thumbs up from me, but only under the condition that this is not applied in the same mass quantities that I catch the few well-off cats using Aventus in my local environs, since this stuff has the potential to be even stronger and more noticeable. Another solid, if not particularly groundbreaking composition that pulls from many stylistic directions at once but feels more conventional for it, from the thrice-rebooted Coach parfums division. Coach Platinum is worthy of at least a sniff from a tester if maybe not a full bottle purchase for the guy well-stocked with modern fragrances. Also, once more for the people in the back: this does NOT smell like Aventus!! ",

What came back was a down home kitchen kind of thing \u2013 not quite apple pie, but perhaps as safe and warming as.\r\nDolce Amalfi oozes a kind of cooked fruit pulp of triple smoothness. Apple and quince are the notes mentioned, and my nose picks out much more of the former which is a shame, as a kitchen permeated by the aroma of bubbling quince can be quite something. A streak of spice runs through it, but again so smooth and creamy, that is blends right in rather than manspreading. The saffron note is that of milky puddings, the cardamom brings its usual cooling sophistication and there are cloves, but they seem satiny rather than firebrands. Underneath is a pillow of  mild vanilla and clean musk.  \r\nDolce Amalfi is a curious thing \u2013 a gourmand perfume that doesn\u2019t read as a gourmand perfume. The fruity spicy notes somehow don\u2019t make the wearer feel that they have been baked into a giant crumble, rather this is a restful, reviving bath in something so silky and luxurious it is easy to say yes to its charms. \r\nHowever, just when I was toying with thoughts that  I might spring for a small bottle of this stuff, came the sad realization that Dolce Amalfi is top-loaded, and after a few hours will subside into a powdery, slightly resinous, vanilla-and-tonka nothing. \n",

It does have bubblegummy (yes, at the surface level it does smell like Juicy Fruit, albeit the most luxurious Juicy Fruit you could possibly imagine) ice creamy shades, but only a smidge - this is a complex fragrance with facets that reveal themselves only after repeated wearings. My first few wearings were dominated by the fruity quince, apple, vanilla, and spices (still a potent and delicious combination), but now the incense and tolu balsam stick out to my nose, making this an even more beautiful and nuanced composition. One thing has remained prevalant throughout my testing of Dolce Amalfi, however, and that is a lovely vanilla - silky, buttery smooth - that leaves an irrestibile aroma in its wake. I am plowing headlong through my 5ml decant and will without doubt be coughing up the cowries for at least a 30ml bottle, only around $100. As far as I know, of the Casamorati line only Dolce Amalfi and Mefisto are available in 30ml, and as much I love fragrances like 1888, Fiero, Regio, and Italica, my wallet cringes at their price tags.

Sci Fi has a really good citrus note combination: beautiful, full, tart, and bright. I can't say enough about how much I like the citrus notes in this; they're marvelous. Green tea shows up just behind the citrus, with a strong hedione edge. The floral notes are there, but they're a gentle backup. There's really very little sweetness to the top and middle notes. It's audacious tart zest, spiked with green tea and just a little smoothed out by florals. \n\r\nThe base notes, however, provide plenty of sweetness. My one disappointment here is that I never get a distinct vanilla. What I get is vanilla lurking in the background, making the cashmere woods something of a sticky, dulce de leche gourmand scent. This is beautiful, so I'm not complaining. It's reminiscent of what happens to the woods in the base notes of Si and La Vie Est Belle, but without the gooey, dirty patchouli (not that patchouli's bad, mind). Minus the patchouli and with the addition of the citrus, it's a far more delicate sweet than either of those.\n\r\nI expected the citrus to fade fast and for the entire thing to wear down to a mix of greenish-smelling hedione and amberish cashmeran. It doesn't. The dulce de leche lingers, and the citruses last remarkably long. This blend wears quite well; further, it's got good sillage without being obnoxious. These Ellis Brooklyn scents aren't beasts, but they wear well enough. I do think the lightness of the notes and the sweetness of the base skew Sci Fi firmly toward feminine (I've sampled all of the current Ellis Brooklyn scents; my feel for them is primarily feminine except for Rives, which I think is truly unisex -- it's basically a foug\u00e8re. Opinions will vary, of course).\n\r\nI don't know that this is otherworldly, and it's not really a true and distinct vanilla scent on me, but this is a really nice clean scent, a well-done blend of sugar-sweet and bright sour.   \n",

I been thinkin' of puttin' up some fencing to keep 'em out, but as long as they clear out 'fore 6PM, which is my porch-sittin' time, I ain't mind much. But one o' them dadgum brats done spilled an entire two-liter bottle of cream soda down there. Like they ain't rascally enough already without all that sugar in 'em! I couldn't hose it out since the only hose tap is around back and I ain't got no extension long enough. It just sat down there stinkin' up the whole porch area all sticky-sweet like for a week, just plum ruinin' my porch-sittin' time, until finally the rains came and washed it all out. Was I happy to never smell that again. \n\r\nOr so I thought, until my order of Terreno Dolce arrived the other day.",

			"content": "Armaf Le Parfait Pour Homme is a cheapie from the noted clone house that\u2019s actually a mix of its clones of Creed Green Irish Tweed and Avenuts, respectively, Tres Nuit and Club de Nuit Intense Man.\n\r\nFirst off, the value and appeal of clone houses and specific offerings like this is palpable, as a standard 100ml bottle of Le Parfait  runs about $18-20 US on FragranceNet.com or FragranceBuy.Ca, contra a creed bottle of similar size costing several hundred dollars retail or maybe $150-200 via the grey market.\n\r\nCost notwithstanding, it\u2019s still a very interesting fragrance, involving both fruity freshness and crisp freshness with sweet and woody tones throughout.  Like many have said, it\u2019s a bit more GIT/Tres Nuit than Aventus/CDNIM, maybe two thirds the former and one third the latter.  The formula feels right, though, and without violet in particular, there\u2019s considerably less bite than in GIT, though I imagine its absence could be a major detractor for some fans.\n\r\nLe Parfait is bright but has a density that helps the fragrance be a lot less faint when it fades from its initial robust projection to being mostly a skin scent after 3 hours, but there\u2019s a considerably difference btween skin scents that are airy and weak versus those line Le Parfait (and like Feuille Verte, which I tried yesterday) that dry down to be dense and rich, but without a ton of projection.  Le Parfait is not as strong as Feuille Verte, but it matches and probably surpasses many Creed freshies.\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m quite impressed with this, both value, creativity (in terms of blending two scents, albeit still cloning), and, of course, unusually great value.\n\n\r\n7 out of 10",

Aqua Regia majors on such notes and if you love them it\u2019s a must try.

I applied it on my neck, behind my ears and just a slight bit on my left interior wrist. The first thing I noticed was how it felt like a perfume oil. I also own Ancient Resins by Aftelier, and Siberian Fir by Evocative Perfumes and SLH goes on much like both of those perfume oil fragrances. It says it's a \"pure perfume\" and perhaps a pure perfume is oil based, but SLH seems to wear like that to me. \n\r\nThe initial fume that rises features pine, but it quickly folds itself into the overall fragrance profile, which is a leather base with wafts of pine, cedar, white floral and rosemary. I can't honestly say I've detected the rosemary yet, but I'm going to be wearing this fragrance for years to come and want to try and identify each nuance.\n\r\nMy favorite part of wearing SLH so far has been the far dry down. That's where the olibanum shows up and helps to ramp up the over all pine note, which is pure bliss for me. However, this is not only pine and olibanum. The blending for this fragrance is as good as any I've had the pleasure to wear.\n\r\nI would say that Soudain l' Hiver is an \"experience,\" and one I'm glad I've been able to have.

			"content": "After giving Blue Oud by Lattafa a few wearings, I decided to help those that were wondering what this smelled like, since there is only Oud listed on this web page.\n\r\nBlue Oud by Lattafa comes in a blue felt-lined box. The bottle is blue-colored and would look great in any collection. The cap fits snugly on top of the bottle and has the word Opulent engraved at the bottom of the cap.\n\r\nI am listing the ingredients along with their scent profiles.\n\r\nThe box for Blue Oud by Lattafa lists the following ingredients, in order:\r\nAlcohol denatured\r\nParfum (Fragrance)\r\nAqua (water)\r\nLinalool: sweet lavender with a touch of citrus\r\nCitronellol: short burst of sweet lemon, which is quickly replaced by the slightly more pungent typical citronella-candle scent. The overall impression however, remains fresh and green and develops a more rose-like, diffusive and slightly oily character over time.\r\nLimonene: smells of oranges.\r\nCoumarin: Is usually derived from the tonka bean and has a sweet odor profile, said to evoke both the scent of newly-mown grass or hay and a distinctive vanilla aroma.\r\nAlpha-Isomethylionone: woody, violet, floral, orris, powdery.\r\nCitral: a lemon-like odor.\r\nGeraniol: waxy, sweet rose odor.\n\r\nWhen sprayed on, I smell floral and citrus notes. After a good while, I detect a very muted musk (possibly?). Due to the cheap price, if there is any oud here, it is definitely synthetic. Personally, I smell no oud.\n\r\nIt seems like Blue Oud would be a good fragrance to wear during the cooler months of the year. Projection was within an arm's length. Longevity was around 7 hours on my skin, becoming a skin scent at the 5 hour mark. \n\r\nDo not confuse Lattafa's Blue Oud with Arabian Oud's Blue Oud. Though they share the same name, they are not at all alike. Arabian Oud's version is a lot more expensive, contains Cambodian Oud, Blue Musk, and Indian Agar Wood. Also, Arabian Oud's version comes with both an EdP and a bottle of oil.\n\r\nIf you are looking for something cheap to wear with mostly citrus and floral, that will also look nice in your collection, go for the Lattafa. If you want real oud with musk, get Arabian Oud's version. Arabian Oud has my vote.\n\r\nFor myself, Blue Oud by Lattafa is more of a \"Like\" than a \"Love\" but for the nice cheap price, it is not bad at all.\n\r\n6.5 out of 10",

I've applied it skin just now, and it's much better. I still feel like it's not quite as good as it was in 2012. In addition to having the incense note, that version had more distinct florals. I felt like I was smelling jasmine. This newer version smells like aldehydes and powder, and it's nice, but I feel like they could give it more of a floral concentrate boost to make it worthy of its historical reputation. \n\r\nIt becomes sweet woods in the base.

			"content": "Bvlgari has been somewhat exhaustive with their male fragrance flankers, making sure every line has an entry that cashes in on some fad or trend, or contains the magic ambroxan note somewhere in the base. Bvlgari Man Wood Essence (2018) is another such exhaustive flanker, that tries to tick all the boxes and fails at most of them, but it isn't a horrible scent overall. We get the \"ambergris\" base line that carries the scent, piled on top by an array of old-school goodies like cedar, vetiver, benzoin, and citrus, with an honest attempt of merging the \"ambroxan bomb\" trope that has monopolized male fragrance counters for much of the 2010's with artistic values borrowed from the brief resurgence of late 90's and early 2000's green aromatics. Bvlgari Man Wood Essence doesn't entirely succeed at melding these concepts together because an ambergris accord, whether natural or synthetic, is a warm animalic/mineralic accord that mixes better with floral, oriental, or aquatic tones than with anything herbacious, aromatic, or woodsy. We used to have oakmoss to anchor our green and woodsy things but that has been done away with, so I understand the idea of \"making it work\" since we all know ambroxan has wiggled its way into every other genre of masculine perfume, but in green aromatic setting like Bvlgari Man Wood Essence tried to provide, the sweet/salty/warm accord of the \"ambergris\" note clashes. \n\r\nIf we set out misgivings aside for just a second, and focus on the rest of the fragrance, Bvlgari Man Wood Essence isn't half bad, starting off as most things in years past have with some citrus and coriander spice. They didn't use the obvious choice of bergamot here, but I believe that is mostly an attempt to stray away from the old-school dry nature that note usually puts forth in scents like these, mixing in something more akin to a slightly-sweeter grapefruit and tangerine mix to go with that coriander. The heart notes of Haitian vetiver and cypriol continue the green theme, adding a bit of grassy nuttiness from the particular strain of vetiver used here mixing with the spice. The cypriol moves us into benzoin, which thickens things up and allows the cedar accord of the base to form, but the ambroxan will not go quietly amidst such aromatic bedfellows, sticking out like a sore thumb and dragging the rest of Bvlgari Man Wood Essence into some weird sort of \"fresh sweet\" designer finish that is very much at odds with the other 90% of the fragrance. The way the ambergris accord shows up to dominate and cast the rest of the composition in an entirely different light is the biggest failure of Bvlgari Man Wood Essence, and the biggest reason I can't go above a neutral on it in rating; it really is like shoehorning something such as Salvatore Ferragamo Pour Homme (1999) on top of the base of Bleu de Chanel (2010) and calling it a day because it's what the house asks of the perfumer, and by extension, what \"the people\" want according to the marketing team. Wear time is somewhat low for an eau de parfum, although sillage is about what is expected: denser and less projecting. This has office use written all over it.\n\r\nAlberto Morillas of all people was assigned to this, and although he is quite capable of genius when left to his own devices, it's clear he also knows how to bang 'em out to order faster than a fry cook Five Guys Burger and Fries. It's kind of sad, because I'm sure he probably saw this as being a mistake when making it, but also probably excepted the challenge of trying to merge the ubiquitous \"bro juice\" dry down of all the big commercial players with a composition that is otherwise against the grain. If graded by merit of sheer experimentalism, Bvlgari Man Wood Essence is a resounding success, but it really isn't the risk taker I make it out to be because regardless of how this opens or develops, it dries to the same chemical thud of everything else made in the wake of Bleu de Chanel or Dior Sauvage (2015). Bvlgari themselves have been striking misses left and right anyway, with nothing really of much interest since the last Bvlgari Pour Homme (1995) flanker dropped under the name Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir (2006). Still, taste is subjective and for those who like the Bvlgari Man (2010) line thus far, this one is worth a sniff. For everyone else, don't expect to be wowed, and if you dig the awkward mesh of tones on display here, you're probably a tad more eclectic than the average fellow anyway, which can only be a good thing in a day and age of homogenity. Odd, interesting, but not really enjoyable for me, but don't take my word for it, Bvlgari Man Wood Essence gets a solid E for effort.",

Pipe tobacco, Tonka, sage in the opening. Tonka is often a fragrance killer for me, and while it is present and focused, it doesn't seem garish. Its really an herbal aromatic fragrance to me.  As it dries in the mid I do get the iris (orris), but this doesn't have any of the knockout beauty or effemination that can come with it.  Here it's use is more textural, giving the fragrance a smoother background creamy butter effect.  Longevity was good, projection average.  Ideal fragrance performance in my opinion.  This is a really good fragrance.  I dismissed it because it was made by Aramis, don't.  \n",

It is a fairly smooth and soft tobacco, combining a rounded fresh-cigar impression, think Upman Havana, with touches of sweetish pipe tobacco \u00e0 la Erinmore Mix.  Quite a pleasant tobacco impression, who at times is enhanced by touches of a discreet sage with hints of a rather restrained iris note. \n\r\nTowards the base a vanilla note becomes more noticeable and grows quickly to take over the lead.  It is a rich and smooth vanilla that remains balanced enough to be never too intrusive or cloying.   Memories of Tom Ford\u2019s Tobacco Vanilla and Le Labo\u2019s Vanille 44 come to mind, with the latter, from the same Est\u00e9e Lauder stable, being a bit more nuanced and more textured.  \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, excellent projection and a superb thirteen hours of longevity on my skin.   \n\r\nA nice autumnal scent, this has very little to do with the delightful original.  This tobacco flanker is composed of less distinguished ingredients, and it is a bit more predictable in the tobacco and the vanilla components, but it nonetheless results in an agreeable, albeit not very original fragrance.  The performance is outstanding.   3.25/5\n\n",

			"content": "Aramis as a house has the habit of pumping out flankers with little to no fanfare these days, then instantly dump them into discounters. I'm not sure of the marketing strategy behind this habit, as it seems some of what is produced ends up being very good, but it happens more and more especially in the wake of the house seemingly ceasing to produce separate lines outside The Gentleman's Collection. Aramis Tobacco Reserve (2018) is one such flanker, housed in the same classic bottle as the original Aramis (1964), but sharing none of its DNA. It's safe to say Aramis as a house has stopped trying to reinvent itself with youth grabs like Aramis New West (1988) or Aramis Life (2003), and given up on its foray into the Middle East market with the Perfume Calligraphy (2012) series, focusing on the mature man that seemingly \"graduates\" from yonger styles into the brand after nearing middle age, alongside its legacy customers. To that end, Aramis Tobacco Reserve feels like a modern tobbaco scent a vintage fan or older fellow used to something like Aramis Havana (1994) might enjoy if they're willing to accept a touch of tonka sweetness and a lack of real oakmoss. \n\r\nAramis Tobacco Reserve comes across like a powderier, more genteel Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille (2007), with the vanilla pulled out, tonka diale down, and cigar tobacco note pushed forward. The scent overall is rather linear, and you will give the impression of having smoked a fine cigar around anyone who catches your sillage, but there is some development. Blackcurrant and nutmeg are \"album openers\" on this little collection of notes, but I honestly get little of that as the tobacco note is so forward in this. You get a bit of clary sage and powdery iris to steer this away from the usual tonka sweetness overload of modern tobacco fragrances, but there is  sweetness to this for some balance. The base is coumarin and evernyl (in place of restricted oakmoss) which gives Aramis tobacco reserve some foug\u00e8re-like qualities in the end, but that tobacco note paired with the iris just keeps throbbin all the way until the end. Wear time is practically all day, and like all tobacco scents, this can get quite cloying if over-applied, so be careful. I'd say this is ideal in fall or winter, as a formal or \"stepping out\" fragrance, but is too baroque for the office or casual setting.\n\r\nFans of that rich cohiba vibe okay with designer brands will no doubt appreciate the simple pleasures of Aramis Tobacco Reserve, and even people into higher-end niche because this approaches that level of quality, but obviously artisanal guys hellbent on perfumes without lab-derived ingredients will see this for what it is: a very potent one-trick pony without any significant development on skin. Most folks into the contemporary tobacco vibe favor a linear heavy-handed approach to the subject, so this is fine cosidering who makes it and how it is distributed, being something of a dark horse contender against bot fellow Lauder family label Tom Ford and fraghead favorite L'Occitane Eau des Baux (2006). There are some things in the Phaedon and Mancera lines that smoke this (pun intended), but for anything more nuanced and  comple, one must seek artisanal lines or vintages. Aramis Tobacco Reserve is a bit straightforward and probably doomed to discounter obscurity  surprisingly good for something released seemingly as an afterthought for a median-age median-income demographic Este\u00e9 Lauder otherwise ignores anymore.

The scent is a very agreeable tobacco scent, seemingly marketed toward and a bit more traditionally designed with men in mind.  It\u2019s only mildly both sweet and spicy with tobacco in the center, a very interesting and balanced combination.  What\u2019s more curious is that it manages to be sweet with neither the familiar tobacco partners of vanilla nor honey, but rather, a blend of blackcurrant, nutmeg, and tonka, and the mix is sharpened/spiced up not only by nutmeg but also clary sage and iris on a bed of oakmoss.\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s a really neat formula that produces a versatile, sophisticated tobacco experience that is easily accessible to those that are put off by either overly-sweet tobacco fragrances or fragrances that simply have too much or too realistic tobacco.  Its performance leaves something to be desired, in my opinion, but modest performance has its advantages, too: the fragrance can be applied more liberally and in varying weather and social circumstances.\n\r\nThe retail pricing of Tobacco Reserve is $78 for 110ml, with discount sometimes available at the department store at which it is sold, but it became reasonably quickly available in US discount stores like Marshalls for only $25, at which the fragrance is really a steal, in my opinion.\n\r\nMost importantly, the smell of Tobacco Reserve itself is really great and I\u2019m a big fan.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

It doesn't scream off the skin but makes its presence known, It boasts surprising longevity (it survived a shower and some aggressive scrubbing).\n\r\nAramis Tobacco Reserve conjures up images of an older gentleman with a finely groomed gray beard, wearing a lightly wrinkled linen suit, smoking a cigar in some sunny locale near to the equator.",

			"content": "Here we have an interesting premise and a semi-clever way to attempt dodging the decline of celebrity-branded scents in the mainstream market, Nick Jonas (yes, THAT Nick Jonas from the former Disney starlets The Jonas Brothers) decided to team up with designer John Varvatos for a signature scent under the John Varvatos brand, rather than pursuing an eponymous fragrance label like so many other celebrities have done. This hearkens back to Avon or Coty teaming with celebrities or athletes, but it's safe to say John Varvatos is on a whole different level from Avon in terms of respect from the fragrance buying public, so a move such as this may be seen as somewhat shocking. Of course, many people out of the gate are going to yell \"eww Nick Jonas\", as seeing his name on a bottle of fragrance is about equal to seeing Selena Gomez or One Direction get a partnership with a designer, and I can understand. All derision for former teen pop stars aside, what we actually get in this collaboration is the John Varvatos take on the 2010's \"ambroxobomb\" trope that's steamrolled all the variety out of the designer segment for male-marketed perfume. John Varvatos has been adept at mostly avoiding the bandwagon, with only Artisan (2009) and the line which came after being anywhere close to a mainstream clean/sweet generalist staple from the brand. With JV x NJ (2018), Varvatos benefits in the reputation department from blaming the obvious cash-in on being Nick Jonas' idea, while Mr. Jonas himself gets a bespoke fragrance from a reputable designer that's sold to whatever fans he has left in the world. The scent of JV x NJ is pretty unsurprising, and like how Jay-Z went after Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008) for his Jay-Z Gold (2013), Nick Jonas clearly has gone after Bleu de Chanel (2010), which means there is a modicum of class here.\n\r\nThe alternative to copying Bleu de Chanel could have always been trying to copy Dior Sauvage (2015), but too many other designers have already done that, so I give props to both John and Nick for dodging that bullet. JV x NJ on paper looks like a Bleu de Chanel clone, but in execution is a mix of styles from the genre that blossomed in Bleu de Chanel's wake, with bits of Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013) and YSL Y Eau de Toilette (2017) in there all swirled around. The opening draws the biggest comparison to the Chanel, with pink pepper, bergamot and mandarin, but adds a bit more zest with Kaffir lime leaves (just lime to my nose) and cascalone, a drier modified version of calone, the old melony staple from the 90's. There is mint here too like in the Chanel, but it is moved down to the heart so all you get is citrus and pepper at first, but once the element emerges, JV x NJ cools down and adds lavender to the mix, making it a bit rounder like Bleu de Chanel Parfum (2018) but without the strength or woodsy aura. Hedione, rosemary, and sage add a bit of clean herbal/soapy barbershop masculinity like the throwback elements in Y Eau de Toilette, but the base here is clearly pulled from the syrupy sweet glow of Invictus, so none of the itch normally associated with Y Eau de Toilette shows up. Ambrox super mixed with vetiver, \"Clearwood\" (norlimbanol), Iso E Super, and some fuzzy fake sandalwood compound that feels more like cashmeran to me. I like most of the development in JV x NJ until we reach this lazy base, which makes this love letter to 2010's designer trends feel more like a cover band trying to play songs from The Jonas Brothers than just another band in the same happy-go-lucky teen pop rock genre wanting to be its own take on the style. In other words, this one wears its inspirations on its sleeves and you're really better off just getting Bleu de Chanel, or even Invictus, as both are the better-executed originals.\n\r\nWear time for JV x NJ is decent, and sillage is also decent, but do we really need another fragrance that is just \"decent\" in this style? Just as in the 80's where every other masculine wanted to be Kouros (1981) or Drakkar Noir (1982), the 2010's has been all about take after take on Bleu de Chanel or Sauvage, and I've really grown to like what can be done with ambroxan as an ambergris alternative, but here it just ain't happenin' McGhee. Rodrigo Flores-Roux makes all the fragrances for John Varvatos, and most of them are solid even if not spectacular, so I know he is a more-than-competent perfumer. However, with JV x NJ he either took the day off or really just phoned in the smell based on word-for-word instructions from Mr. Jonas, and if we know anything about a fragrance made to-order, it's that the outcome is usually limited to the knowledge and taste of the commissioner. Therefore, I give this a neutral rating for being a harmless, boring, \"good-enough\" entry into the crowded ambroxan blue juice genre that honestly didn't need another example that plays off of established styles. I wouldn't fault anyone for owning this, because someone looking for a dumb-reach modern daily driver could be talked into this by a sales associate just as easily as any of the above things I named, just knowing what's really out there even within the limitations of this style makes JV x NJ little more than a cleverly-orchestrated vanity plate for the celebrity involved. Oh well, I'm sure this will one day prove collectable when John Varvatos eventually runs his course with whatever licensing deal he has and discontinues the fragrance. Likeable enough, but also passable, just like Nick Jonas' former band. ",

Everything's darker, especially the moss and spice. It's not bad, but if the EDC was tapdancing on my skin, the EDP is clogging in wooden shoes. (I'm mixing my singer and dancer metaphors, but hopefully you get my drift.)\n\r\nNow the sad part: as admirable and pretty as the vintage EDC is, it isn't really something I would want to smell on a man. Unless, possibly, that man was Fred Astaire. It's almost too lovely; I think I prefer my masculine scents to be a little more.... spiky?\n\n\n",

			"content": "Dolce & Gabbana have really nosedived in the 2010's with their masculines, and are either run by robots, or are letting the robots design their perfumes with algorithms designed to make olfactory Kool-Aid out of the most-trending fragrance notes of the decade, since The One Grey (2018) smells neither particularly interesting, original, nor like it was even composed by a Human being at all. I've heard this argument lobbed at Dior Sauvage (2015), and while I won't deny the possibility that some IBM-grade science wasn't used for that scent, it really must have been exclusively deployed here. Furthermore, only a machine would think to make such inane flankers like Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme Intenso (2014), or additions to established lines like Light Blue Pour Homme Italian Zest (2018), that bedazzle with marketing themes or packaging graphics only to deliver something so tepid, so uninspired to smell, that it's literally angering. At least with The One Grey, you can see that this is a boring also-ran with literally zero personality or originality before you even smell it. Is this some kind of satirical social commentary on the state of mainstream white collar male business culture? If it is, bravo Dolce & Gabbana, you really got me good with this one, now please get back to making decent fragrances again. This stuff is designed like they almost wanted to capture the \"grey\" of an office cubicle in a dead-end data entry position where supervisory positions are always outside hires with business management degrees fresh out of community college, and the training you were promised to get that promotion is just a dangled carrot to get more productivity out of the same pay grade. Bleh.\n\r\nTo make matters worse, The One Grey seeks to be the \"cheaper alternative to Tom Ford\" for the guys in those same hired-from-a-job-fair positions who want to smell like the Grey Vetiver (2009) their bosses wear but don't want to cross into triple digit price territory to do so, and have exhausted all their free samples from Nordstrom, so they get in under $100 by buying this and \"make it work\". Granted, cheapo alternatives are a matter of business for some houses, just ask Avon, Armaf, or Lomani about that, but at least they have enough self-awareness to put a unique and enjoyable spin to their usually-respectable downmarket homages. The One Grey opens with a truly enjoyable hesperidic vetiver note, probably the best part of the whole fragrance, but like many mediocre designers in this same category, the top notes are all it's got. The grapefruit and vetiver eventually merge with some dry lavandin (a more medicinal variant of lavender), then some cardamom to muddle things up a bit, which is actually bad because fresh vetivers are usually soapy and clean, not brown and spicy. For me, it's this clash of values which sets the tone for the rest of the scent, and the biggest sign that this was potentially made by IBM's Wattson and not a perfumer, since cardamom is popular in many designers now. Amber, norlimbanol and Iso E Super posing as \"grey woods accord\" (yeah right guys, give me a break), and a fake \"tobacco\" that's little more than tonka and trickery are the final stages of the scent, with the grapefruit coming back in the end to be made unpleasantly sweet by the amber, drowning out the vetiver. Luckily performance is on par with the original The One for Men (2008), so very quiet, even if longevity is decent enough.\n\r\nI don't know, I try to give a lot of designers a fair chance to show their inner beauty in spite of being juiced up worse with chemical enhancement than an Olympic bodybuilder or professional wrestler, and there have been a great many which have been unfairly thrashed by fragrance community snobs when they actually have some merit, accounting for taste of course. However, there isn't even a slight sliver lining to this very \"grey\" cloud, one that is looming ever greater over the house of Dolce & Gabbana if stuff like this is the future of their creative direction. We've already seen a decade of inane flankers for older lines, and their last new masculine pillar is from the 200o's, which is stretching into Chanel-length development cycles, but without the Chanel reputation for quality and originality. Honestly, if this really is an attempt to cash in on renewed interest in vetiver, there are so many better options at the same or lower prices than this, it's existence is irrelevant, and if it is indeed meant to be a cheaper take on Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver, guess what? It's only maybe half again cheaper at retail unless buying from a discounter, which is where stock of this is likely destined anyway. Huge Thumbs down, and if you end up with this as a gift, just bring it to the office for the next Secret Santa, just don't blame me if they fire you for your sardonic sense of humor. This is a veritable flusher for me, but I won't discount that a lot of you folks really into vetiver might actually be interested in something like this despite its huge flaws, or just something \"perfectly boring\" to wear when you have the pragmatic urge to smell like little extra besides deodorant. Make sure to sample this first, which shouldn't be too difficult at department stores, who will literally thrust something like this into your hand at warp speed, especially during sales events. This holds not a single candle to the original The One for Men, which is worlds apart and actually a good gourmand fragrance. ",

There\u2019s lemon in Eau Savage but in Acide it\u2019s definitely pushed to the max! It\u2019s stunning, metallic and sweet and to my nose screams limoncello and lemon gelato, which gives Acide a more modern and young feel.\n\r\nOnce the lemon quiets down, it seems to change a lot depending on the day and when I wear it but generally it makes me think of a bad boy version of Chanel Pour Monsieur. Sometimes it\u2019s like jasmine tea or herbal or even hay. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I also smell some salty seaweed notes, though not in the official list. The fragrance is rich and well made for a cologne because the sparkling lemon lasts a long time on my skin, a whole day, and even longing on my clothes, but the splash bottle is not practical for that. \n\r\nIt\u2019s retro and possibly nostalgic but also unique and has an unusual, fresh animalic signature that some might not like but could be considered very sensual and manly by others.

There is something classic in the general structure (vaguely herbal/aromatic, restrained and purely virile). A quite elusive fragrance teleporting us in a sort of ninetheenth century cultured and baroquely decadent atmosphere. Licorice/rhubarb-roots, wild grass, dry vetiver and black dianthus provide a darkly soapy/herbal aura (rich of floral, botanic, leafy and woody nuances). The aroma is quite sharp (vaguely 80's on the dry structure but at same time cleaner and more essential), really grassy/floral (but with a soapy background), vaguely berrish (red/purple), penetrating, pounding, a nocturnal, cultured,  somewhat melancholic (warm and impenetrable) creation for a lost demented seducer nearby the Court-Palace.",

It's sweet but much milder than the first Uomo, with a denser, more complex structure that keeps revealing new facets as you wear it.\n\r\nIf the original Uomo was a sort of \"clubbing\" gourmand, this is its dressed-up cousin, a touch more mature but still warm and youthful enough for casual wear. It's mighty strong stuff, so it probably isn't suited for the office.",

			"content": "The original Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo (2016) was an ambroxan-fueled aromachemical take on the gourmand theme introduced in earnest through Thierry Mugler A*Men (1996), and was composed by Alberto Morillas and Aurelian Guichard. That original scent has its fans but is clearly dialed towards capitalizing on the \"ambroxan bomb\" category which has been a runaway success for designer perfumery in the male segment. For Uomo Signature (2018), Alberto Morillas returns alone for something more personal, more special, and less-reliant on vulgar chemical overdoses, even though they are still there, just dialed back to become part of the composition instead of the focus. In the place of such a huge ambroxan sledgehammer comes a coffee note, bringing the Morillas-penned Uomo Signature even closer to that of A*Men, but this is no pure homage, and manages to stand on its own two legs just fine. Uomo Signature isn't exciting, and it isn't revolutionary, but as a modern designer still using ambroxan as a slight crutch, it is more respectable than many in its category. Guys who already have gourmands in their wardrobe may feel something like Uomo Signature is redundant, but I don't think the scent seeks the attention of the hardcore Colognoisseur anyway.\n\r\nSalvatore Ferragamo Uomo Signature opens with mandarin orange, pink pepper, and some dusty nutmeg. It doesn't take long at all for the cardamom to follow up, and it is a pretty thick application of the stuff too, so you had better like spicy if you are to like this. Uomo Signature is so much thicker in this regard to the original Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo that if there was any doubt the older one was a winter scent, there is no shred of uncertainty about what kind of weather in which you should wear signature, especially when the cinnamon comes in to kick ass alongside the cardamom. This is a spicy as gourmands tend to get here, but the coffee and patchouli tandem playing the biggest respect to A*Men shows up in a few minutes after the top and middle unfold, with a gentler application of both than the older Thierry Mugler scent, bolstered by the warm glow of a dialed-back ambroxan and musk. If Uomo Signature is any kind of bomb at all, it is a tonka bomb, for the sheer overdose of coumarin in the base of this takes over for the coffee, patchouli, and ambroxan during the final skin scent phase, merging with the musk to radiate on skin for hours. Supposedly a leather note is here, but I don't get much of that myself, even though I admit being something of a leather stickler so if it doesn't hit me in the face, I'm not satisfied with it. Wear time is a full day being an eau de parfum, but sillage is not as intense, so you won't have to worry about suffocating anyone in your winter commute to the office in a subway car or carpool, but I would still suggest moderating sprays anyway.\n\r\nSalvatore Ferragamo isn't exactly my cup of tea, and its hodgepodge of modern chemistry with 90's gourmand revival aesthetics more than makes up for the craven monster that is the original Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo, since Siganture shows better blending and some restraint, trading ambroxan for more tonka and some clever use of classic gourmand notes. Once again, this is no breakthrough for the brand, and certainly holds no candle to the original Salvatore Ferragamo Pour Homme (1999) or even F by  Ferragamo Pour Homme (2007), which were worked on by Jacques and son Olivier Polge respectively, and do things in finer filigrees than usually manageable by mainstream darling Morillas. Still, this is a safe thing to explore for a younger guy that wants to try his hand with some gourmand tones, but doesn't wish to stray too far \"from the light\" of convention just yet, so the artistic merging of what he already knows with what he has yet to try works out pretty well. Thumbs up from me, but as with most things readily available in department stores, I encourage a test before committing any cash to the purchase. A kinder gentler, more modern A*Men this is in spirit, but that may not be enough for the seasoned hobbyist. ",

There is a sexy smokiness enveloping the entire creation.\n\r\nThe earliest amber scent I had heretofore been aware of was Coty\u2019s Ambre Antique (1910) in the iconic tall crystal flacon, with Roman maidens embossed about its surface. I have not to date been able to experience the contents, so cannot make a comparison.\n\r\nI am not really a fan of amber as a central note in perfume, finding that it can often be nauseatingly pungent, as in Creed\u2019s Ambre Canelle (1949). The Guerlain however is as always a masterful blend, with supporting notes only enhancing, not overwhelming the central theme.\n\r\nThe orange blossom and ylang ylang in the heart notes round out the already quite round opening trio and the dry down makes good use of the creaminess of vanilla, tonka and sandalwood.\n\r\nSo, here we have strong amber, cedar and leather, rounded with creamy notes and topped with sparkling spices.  Expertly done and wearable by either sex. The first amber parfum I have liked. Luckily, it is still available on line from private sellers in decant flacons.\n\r\nVery worth seeking out for those who love amber.\n",

That same warm vanillic base, rich, dark and creamy. Cordoba however veers off in a different direction. By adding carnation, clove and cinnamon to the mix, with a leather undertone, it achieves that spicy leather accord, which sets it apart from these others.\n\r\nAlthough not in the note tree, the effects of amber, vanilla and musk are most prominent to my nose. This is a rich and voluptuous perfume, one that might have been worn with furs. In the vein of the Weil scents, it might even be at home sprinkled on the furs themselves.\n\r\nIt is interesting to me that it premeried the same year (1953) as Youth Dew. If one did not know that two different houses presented these to the world, a modern nose might even see one as a flanker to the other.\n\r\nThis is a marvelous leather, rich, warm and spicy. Highly recommended to lovers of the Tabu/Youth Dew musky amber genre.\n\n\n\n",

I say mainstream, but although this is available in the UK you tend to have to go through Ebay and the like.

Its essentially a two-part thing: the opening is a photo-realistic grapefruit, all juicy acidity. The transition aims at producing a warm take on cedar, hence the ginger. This works well and produces at the end of the drydown something almost akin to D&G's The One, only without a tobacco note. \n\r\nIt doesn't last too long, but I find this likeable for the duration and will probably get through my 60ml bottle in short order.

			"content": "Well, ck One Platinum (2018) isn't a total train wreck, but coming from a house that seems complacent with tossing out mediocre releases to pad a catalog that is literally a seven nation army of flankers, I'm not the least bit surprised. What I am surprised with however, is the fact that such a listless release would fall under the usually exemplary ck One line of fragrances. You have to understand, Calvin Klein defined so much of what a modern designer fragrance is, from \"his and hers\" pairs of fragrances under the same title like Obsession (1985) and Obsession for Men (1986), to helping reset the entire industry by weighing in with a hugely significant fragrance that coined the term \"fresh foug\u00e8re\" with Eternity for Men (1989), it really goes without saying that everything not already in development from 1990 on was inspired at least in part by the creative direction of Calvin Klein. Their biggest achievement in fragrance was the cK One (1994) line, which openly and ostentatiously denounced gender barriers by being a painstaking exercise in then cutting-edge synthetic perfumery that sought to imply no sexual identity one way or the other, and the controversy which ensued is the stuff of legend. Love or hate the olfactive gray musk cloud that is cK One, we wouldn't have a proliferation of intentionally-unisex fragrance without it. Calvin Klein has been very mindful of this fact, and have almost treated the ck One line as a golden child, with arguably the house's most creative efforts coming out under it, while the main lines received an army of chemical Frankenstein's monsters that have been entertaining at best, or embarrassing at worst, with varying degrees of commercial success. Unfortunately, that long streak of unmitigated success in the cK One line comes to an end with ck One Platinum. What we have here, is an extremely lazy and super-fruity re-purposing of the primary accord from ck One Gold (2016), but without anything that made ck One Gold special.\n\r\nThe fruit over ambroxan and guaiac wood returns with ck One Platinum, but none of the richness or herbal qualities make an appearance in ck One Platinum, as if Calvin Klein wanted to try redoing ck One Gold without any of the personality, following the most minimum of modern fruity fresh requirements. Admittedly, ck One Platinum also feels like the first fragrance in the series that really tips over the gender line to the feminine side, whereas ck Be (1996) was the first (and so far only) unisex entry that seemed to sway a little too masculine, although it has been embraced by the LGBTQ+ community alongside the original cK One so it dodged being seen as the unnecessary capitulation to straight men afraid of ck One that it really was. ck One Platinum on the other hand, feels like the equal oppposite: the core aesthetic of ck One Gold rearranged into a modern feminine fruity floral for ladies who may have felt too conflicted with past entries, containing just a tiny speck of anything masculine in the base to justify the ck One moniker. We open with grapefruit, green apple and apricot here, very sweet fruity anything-at-the-Macy's-counter in design, that dusts off with a bit of cardamom and something called \"modern aldehydes\". Well, at least the \"Kleinisms\" are still in full effect, but while you go and figure out what a modern aldehyde is, I'll keep going with this review. Pink pepper, cinnamon, and lavender are supposedly here, but all I get is the white floral core borrowed from cK All (2017) but without the dustiness or citrus, and finally a base of vetiver over cashmeran synth woods aka that ambroxan and norlimbanol dream team with a dollop of soft amber, which is the only thing making this even remotely appealing to someone looking for a unisex fragrance. Seriously, the vetiver at the end over the fake woods mumbo jumbo is the only link to any sort of masculine trope in the whole deal, and reminds me in part of Oscar de la Renta Gentleman (2016) with the execution of citrus and vetiver, even if the citrus here is accompanied by a fruit basket that will scare a lot of people away from ck One Platinum. I like collecting ck One fragrances, but this one is a huge stretch even for me, but I will likely end up getting it just because one of my personality quirks demands it, even if I can't really give this any higher than a neutral rating.\n\r\nOh well, it's not like I don't have several Calvin Klein scents I gave a neutral rating to in my collection anyway, so I guess I'm just a sucker for the house after all. Even among Calvin Klein's somewhat checkered history of taking synthetic notes to dazzlingly abstract heights or pumping out senseless numbers of flankers just to hold the buying public's attention, ck One Platinum registers pretty low in the standings. This is the first cK One scent I have actually been disappointed in, and although I don't hate it, I get the feeling this was an unused formula for a feminine perfume redressed by perfumers Ilias Ermenidas and Pierre Negrin into a cK One formula to recoup development costs of an unlaunched perfume, which is the same suspicion I've made of several other ck One scents, including ck One Shock for Him (2011), which is an amazing tobacco fragrance that really should not have been put into a cK One bottle. If you're a collector of the line, I can't stop you from buying this, but if you really want a good starting point into the cK One dynasty of enforced-unisex fragrances, you should at least start back with cK All if you don't want to go all the way back to cK One itself (which is where I would tell anyone to start otherwise). Fans of fruity florals, imagine your favorite genre laced with warm ambrox and grassy vetiver, and you'll get an idea of what awaits you in a bottle of ck One Platinum. I also find the marketing of a \"platinum\" scent to be a little bit out of step, since platinum itself was rather popular in the 90's and early 2000's as a precious metal for jewelry in the hip hop community, but seeing something that isn't a credit card marketed as \"platinum\" in the late 2010's just feels like it spawned from the head of an old guy in the marketing department who still thinks the kids play Sega or listen to Korn on their Sony Discman portable CD players. Jeeze man, this really is just a hair's breadth away from being a train wreck, if not for that final dry down. Recommended use is casual for this if you pull the trigger on a bottle. That's all I got. ",

This juice conjures me intensely a favorite of mine, the muskier and equally citric-resinous Etro Messe de Minuit. Urban Scents Dia de los muertos is a superb assertive fragrance rich of liturgy and spirituality, a scent which evokes in my mind midnight masses impregnated by the aroma of burning incense and memories about juvenile walks around the churchyard's silent alleys pervaded by the aroma of flowers and \"dust\". Frankincenses, rubber, woody-smoky patchouli and citrus are heady but I'm quite sure several further notes are included in the blend (I suppose myrrh, balsams, musks and some floral patterns). The aroma is vaguely fizzy/acid for a while along the top stage, in order of sliding soon towards a spiritual fruity-floral aura incredibly pervasive (definitely obsessive) and almost \"yummy\" (yes it seems to stimulate senses and palate). I detect neroli in particular, a spicy neroli quite intense and \"relentless\" (the day of dead is pervaded by the aroma of flowers as well). I appreciate enormously the well calibrared juxtaposition of smokey resins and citrus/floral, overall enveloled by a sort of connective musky/amberish blanket. A wonderful evocative fragrance able to teleport us in to a southern medieval atmosphere countersigned by burning torches, secret ceremonies, massive nobiliar buildings, medieval towns and nocturnal masses.

Sharp, nose-prickling \"solar\" aldehydes wake you up, followed by dapper, natty petigrain, a nostalgic \"Art Deco\" neroli, to create a hesperidic sheen of refreshment. Gradually in the drydown, subtle white florals add their vernal winsomeness, spiked by very outdoorsy and health-filled green lawn notes. An image of fine French soap gives you a feeling of vintage clean-ness. In farthest drydown, a whisper-subtle bed of tagetes, sandalwood and a pure skin musk give a distant note that reminds you of tanned skin after a long day at the pool or beach.\n\r\nThis new fragrance is both to-the-minute in style, with its glassy/linear sheen of top-heavy minimalism; yet it directly alludes, I feel, to the very first eaux-de-cologne as they appeared in the 1700's in Cologne, Germany. In fact, COME TOGETHER is making a direct allusion, I am convinced, to the very first well-known K\u00f6lnisch Wasser invented by Johann-Maria Farina in 1709.\n\r\nThis is one of those sparkling, \"tonic\" scents that I like to save for summer's hottest months--- which in South Texas are July and August. In fact, at that time, I stash it in the fridge, so it goes on wonderfully cold. Lovely and revitalizing after a long airplane or car trip.\n\r\nI love the flacon for COME TOGETHER, suggesting as it does oldschool barber's tonic bottles, with their vaguely obelisk shape and graceful shoulders.

Can't go wrong here. Performance on this is infamously slight, so that was my main worry. It was below average in all aspects. It projected its softish smell for about an hour and a half. But after it becomes a skin scent it is fairly present. The smell of it is so clean and un-skin-like, that even a small hint of its presence is noticeable.

Just the though caught my eyes immediately....\n\r\nMugler Cologne Come Together (green) has the familiar bergamot-neroli-petitgrain pungent verbena green freshness, along with transparent light musk note nested subtly within.  \n\r\nSomehow, this one isn't as mossy as the original Mugler Cologne, following a more \"wet\" fruity-floral route than before, thanks to the inclusion of the lovely orange blossom. I saw parallels before to Lancome's Miracle Homme L'Aquatonic, with a grassy green touch; now, that appears to have been muted or removed.\n\r\nAnd what's with the mysterious \"S\" note? Could it be aclean, fresh \"soap\" scent from his childhood that was the inspiration for the original Mugler Cologne of 2001? Can't even begin to theorize what else it could be.\n\r\nIn the end, Mugler Cologne Come Together is a tidied up eau de cologne that is more linear and predictable than before. It seems to last longer than the original Mugler Cologne, an important factor for me!  And I'm sure there will be a sharp divide among reviewers as to which one is \"better\" or \"more appropriate.\"  Personally, I can see myself sporting this in warmer weather and casual situations. I'm not running around doing cartwheels as the opening blurb suggests that smellers of Come Together might, but I do like it for it being more predictable and longer lasting.\n",

Aside from the lemon leaf which only lasts in the opening of BC&C the similarities abound. The Tonka brings a smoothness to the RAB that the Blue Cedar and Cypress doesn't have. BC&C is sharper overall and reminds me just a bit of the C.O. Bigelow stuff. A very nice, clean fragrance that is well worth the price tag if you're into barbershop.

It reminds of when taxidermists jokingly combine parts from multiple animals into some sort of crazy combination, but that still looks weirdly plausible and somehow works.\n\r\nSo what does it smell like?  Well, that's complicated.  It has Chanel No 18's outer space ice cathedral mix of ambrette and iris, glued together and shot into orbit by a touch of high-pitched violet.  Then, it's also got a very down-to-earth mix of sandalwood and incense, both creamy frankincense, and sharper, greener Tauer-esque resins hovering in the background, giving a continuity of sharpness when combined with the aforementioned high pitched elements.  Additionally, there's a mix of dihydromercinol, ambrox, and a pinch of violet leaf that's very Creed - It's not that this smells like anything Creed has done, but MCM has clearly nicked a pinch of its DNA, using the dihdro's disembodied lavender sheen to launch the whole scent even further into outer space, while the violet leaf melts into the iris and incense (adding a silvery green shimmer), and the ambrox gives further depth and grounding to the woody/incense base.\n\r\nThis should really be awful.  The idea of marrying ambrette weirdness with a woody iris feels like a potential fit, but doing it under the umbrella of a marine fougere is ridiculous.  But it totally works.  It's extremely quirky and likely to appeal only to more openminded sniffers, but the juxtaposition of celestial and earthy, frozen and warm, and unabashed chemical sharpness with smooth richness makes this one of the most deeply interesting and technically satisfying perfumes I've tried all year, and lord knows I try a LOT of perfumes...",

I'm unable to identify any specific flower in the note list, but the whole effect reminds me mostly of freesia, adorned with tiny sparkles of mineral and aquatic nuances.\n\r\nThe fragrance then remains more or less the same afterwards, only turning more musky and abstract with time until the end. The sillage of Carat is relatively soft, while the longevity is around 8 hours on me.\n\r\nAlthough I'm unable to envision all the rainbow colours implied in press release, Carat indeed evokes sparkling diamonds quite well, from the clean, bright, crystalline musky floral to the mineral/metallic accents. The confident, vigorous green aldehydic opening also leaves a strong impression before the perfume falls back to a more familiar, versatile, modern clean musky floral. If you enjoy this type of fragrance in general but would like something with a stronger personality, Carat is worth considering in my opinion.",

			"content": "The good thing about Caron Pour Un Homme L'Eau is that it's the true-to-the-original, lighter L'Eau we've all been waiting for. While I enjoy Sport and think that it's well made, it was quite a departure from CPUH and probably not what most people were expecting. L'Eau remains true to form, comprised mainly of the same sort of lavender/vanilla combination as the original, only made much lighter and with some additional citrus notes that make it more of a warm weather option. Indeed, this is a lighter, airier, more watery version of the original, with soft citrus notes infused throughout and a cooling, partly mineralic/earthy geranium twist laid over the same green, herbal lavender of the original As it develops, L'eau takes on something of a more dry, ozonic air with a warm, salty accent, most likely a result of the ambergris that's listed in its pyramid. There are times when this dry saltiness almost comes across smoky, and it's a unique quality to L'Eau--one aspect which helps give it distinction and personality. In fact the entire scent, despite its lightness and airy structure, is quite distinct. The embellishments that have been added while creating L'Eau do enough to give it its own profile and personality while never straying to far from the theme of the original. And just like the original, everything  concludes in a base of soft vanilla, a smooth, easy landing that's comforting and relaxing.\n\r\nI think real fans of the original and die-hard fragrance enthusiasts are going to appreciate this, though I could see there being one main issue with the more mainstream crowd---it's very light. There will no doubt be some complaints about both projection and longevity, as this is a very airy, and at times subtle fragrance. At its peak, L'Eau projects about 1 foot off the skin, though it does create a pleasant sillage when it catches the air.  It's all but a skin scent in about 5 hours. For some, this will not be enough, but as a lighter option to CPUH, at least to me, this really seems like the perfect execution of the concept. \n\r\nJust to review, L'Eau is an airier, citrus-infused, salty-ambergris-tinged, dry-ozonic and at times even waterier version of the original, with a cooling/earthy geranium accent and overall a much lighter, diffusive density. It's very well done  although it may be too light for those expecting something with more power and presence. For true fans of the original who like the idea of a lighter, l'eau option, I recommend this as a blind buy--it will most likely satisfy your expectations and maintain the essence of the original. For others, who are just casual fans of CPUH, I recommend sampling this first. While it's very good, it may be perceived as \"weak\" by some. Thumbs up, and a final solid rating of 8/10.",

			"content": "First the bad news. Instead of striking out in a new direction for their masculine range Caron have just launched their fourth flanker of Pour un Homme. \n\r\nOn the other hand, the good news: 1) it's  better then the last two efforts and 2) composed by a new perfumer William Fraysse (no doubt the son of the previous incumbent).\n\r\nThe perfume itself is the old lavender and amber classic given a contemporary makeover. The lavender now has a fresh juicy twist with lime and a peppery aquatic and the amber has been paired with ambergris which - with its salty aquatic and fatty aspects cleverly ties in with the changes in the head. There is a geranium note in the middle that hints at foug\u00e8re, but the most interesting part is the addition of an all new burnt caramellic, dusty-woody vetiver and sweet powdery base. This represents a departure from the old formula that works nicely. There's also woody amber in the dry down even if it is quite discrete - for once, but technically that also makes it a spiky wood...\n\r\nWith hindsight the effect is a bit predictable. L'Eau is Pour un Homme for the 21st century. It targets young men, fed up with lamentable teen frags who want something mature but not Fogeyish. It's like Caron are trying to position this as a entry point to a more sophisticated style of masculine. A weaner frag, if you like.\n\r\nAnother thing about l'Eau is it feels a bit overstated. Perhaps this is a consequence of the strain put on the structure as it's bent out of shape, or perhaps it's more to do with the expectations placed on the newbie, but it feels like a demonstration piece designed to showcase a rookie's talent. \n\r\nBut credit where it's due. The new base fits the profile nicely, showing that William Fraysse has learnt the structure inside out. This is no cut and paste job with a few novelties thrown in but a fully reworked composition that (with the caveat that it's been touched up with a grab bag of different motifs) doesn't offend the spirit of the original.\n\r\nIn the long term l'Eau may turn out to be just another flash in the pan flanker, but if it acts as a gateway to the original (which seems to be Caron's strategy) then so much the better. \n\r\nIn the short term however, its significance is more positive. With a new perfumer at the controls the worst of Caron's problems may be coming to an end. It's too early to say right now but l'Eau does give grounds for cautious optimism.\n\r\n***/*\n",

If you got a cup and just ran around the counter spraying everything you saw into the cup, this is what it might smell like when you finished. Really. No personality, just an anonymous modern blend. It\u2019s fresh, it\u2019s kind of sweet, it\u2019s kind of woody in that synthetic amber-y way everything is nowadays, there\u2019s some unidentifiable fruit up top, it moves from tart fruity freshness to ambrox woods and sweet lavender amber tonka. It really seems like an attempt to be as derivative as possible. But it\u2019s not bad. Everything\u2019s put together pretty smoothly and it has a polished, albeit completely synthetic feeling. I know for a fact that nobody will tell you you smell bad while wearing it, and you\u2019ll probably even get a few compliments. But I think this is best for the 25 and under crowd. It just smells so much like the mall, ya know? If I was a kid in high school I\u2019d be perfectly happy using this one as my every day all around go-to scent.

The vanilla is a bit overkill if I\u2019m honest, they could\u2019ve stuck with the creamy floral notes and amped up the sandalwood to add some depth. This is a pleasant scent and would work for anyone with a sweet tooth in their perfume tastes. \n\r\nI found it to be quite potent too for the duration of its wear time. Above average sillage on me but with only moderate longevity of about 5-6\r\nhours. This is still better than the other \u2018dolce\u2019 fragrances in this line, but it really has nothing in common with those anyway besides the bottle template. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this over other tropical florals but I can see this being well liked by many. Pretty but not unique enough for me and dare I say, a bit too sweet.",

			"content": "A Scent Alloy of Lipstick and Penknife\n\r\nIt is barely a few months since ZARA released the Rusty Metal collection, and a brand new metal, or better alloy, is ready to join it, that is Brass Dream. Since there was no tester available and a lot of people waiting on line at the cash, I opted for blindly buy it. In the end, as a collector, I'd have bought it anyway. The package is the same as the other three, both the box and the bottle have a distinctive bright gold-like color. In case you missed it, brass is a metallic alloy that is made of copper and zinc, and this scent is an amalgams, a sub-type of alloy, either. \n\r\nBrass Dream opens up with an explosion of lipstick and penknife accord, an attractive and appealing mix of the floral butteriness of milky vanilla iris and the deep woodiness of freshly cut cedarwood... Whoa! Cedar overloads with the top notes so if you're not a fan of cedar you'd better stay away from this beast. Indeed, if you love cedar then this is a quality fragrance that deserves a try. \r\nThe initial blast is reminiscent of Dior Homme but this soon morphs into something better and different. It's not as overbearing as Dior Homme, but softer and quieter. Average peoples probably couldn't get or tell a difference anyway. The spicy peppery cardamom gently joins that opening, yet it is not too heavy, spicy, or medicinal to cover the other notes. Beautiful, no question about it.\n\r\nNext, in the heart, everything blends together and it smells much like a light pencil sharpener cedar note. It's not loud. It's not rosy, nor sweet. It's just a very inert all-around crowd-pleasing scent. Again, this time the heart is closely akin to Montana Graphite, I mean they are not alike yet they share the same pencil sharpener vibe, the reason why I strongly chased and blindly bought the latter. \n\r\nAfter this, it becomes more aromatic, warmer, deeper and a little sweet. Of course, ZARA reports just 3 main notes, but a few more are present and clearly detectable through the scent lifetime. I find the aromatic lavender and sage manage to dissuade the buttery orris and sweet vanilla from becoming too prominent.\n\r\nDespite it has been released these days, in the middle of the summer, and I' wearing it right now for testing it, it is really a great one for the fall and winter in my opinion. I find the longevity and sillage both adequate for a men EDP and suitable for office, yet they could have boosted the projection more and it still would not be offensive.\r\nThis new release is still very attractive, with a schoolroom scent of pencil shavings that, after an hour or two, settles down into a delightful, if not especially unusual fragrance of the kind that\u2019s often described as \u2018classically masculine\u2019, a bit woody and aromatic without being bitter, slightly sweet without being at all cloying. \r\nAs aforementioned, to me, this reminds me of Dior Homme and Montana Graphite because of the way orris and cedar are blended here. It's not a knockoff of any of those two scents, but I wouldn't doubt if they were its inspiration. \n",

He produced six scents through 1964, the most popular being Celui in 1938 and Gymkana in 1964.\n\r\nCelui opens with a very dry rose, made even drier by the orris and hawthorne notes. The musk and sandalwood provide a woody, reedy effect, equally dry. The gardenia, heliotrope and hyacinth notes are not detectable to my nose. Ambergris and civet provide an animalic sweetness, an effect which could be cloying if not balanced, as they are here.\n\r\nOddly the overwhelming impression is that of immortelle, which provides a gourmand effect of the Indian powdered spice, garum masala. At the same time there is a further dry pungent impression of celery seed. Millot\u2019s Insolent from the 1940s comes closest in resembling Celui, as a reference point.\n\r\nIt all boils down to whether you wish to anoint yourself to suggest working in an herbal spice shop.\r\nAs a dry, fragrant scent, this could work well for summer wear. You are certain to make an impression, fleeting but fresh and dry. The edp I sampled did not have great longetivity. Probably best in its pure parfum concentration.\n\r\nThis is a pleasant scent and recommended for both sexes as dry, woody, slightly gourmand summer splash.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

			"content": "On my skin, Mandarina Corsica is mostly a play-off between two competing accords, namely juicy mandarin and creamy caramel. The madarin scores first with not only its vividly realistic succulent pulps, but also its slightly bitter, even metallic pith, while the caramel looms around the edge. Then the caramel gathers force in the next two hours to gain equal footing with the mandarin. \n\r\nThe caramel in Mandarina Corsica is thankfully not one-dimensional, saccarine syrupiness. Instead, it has a deliciously milky, unctuous texture mimicking the sensation when a cube of caramel starts to melt on the palate. Moreover, there is also a subtle smoky facet, probably borrowed from the immortelle, that enhances the natural feeling of the caramel note, while a delicate touch of tonka beans' powdery almond nuance rounds everything off. \n\r\nThis middle phase of Mandarina Corsica is my favourite part, not only because the caramel note is well constructed and rich in nuances, but also because its juxtaposition with the juicy pulp and metallic pith of mandarin creates an intriguing tension as well as making the caramel appear less heavy. As a result, I'm reminded of D\u00e9liria also from L'Artisan, and Etat Libre d'Orange La Fin du Monde also signed by Quentin Bisch. Not because they smell any similar, but all three have this interesting contrast between various gourmand and metallic elements. I'm also sometimes reminded of Prada Candy at times, as both have an appetizingly unctuous yet not so heavy caramel note, but the mandarine note also plays a strong role in Mandarina Corsica.\n\r\nThe dry down is predictably dominated by the caramel and tonka bean about 5 hours in. Sadly, without the enticing citrus to balance, the caramel and tonka bean tend to become more sugary and flat in the end. The sillage is moderate in general, while the longevity can reach to 10 hours.\n\r\nI initially dismissed Mandarina Corsica as uninteresting upon first sniff, having thought it's merely capitalzing the gourmand trend. But when the different nuances unfold themselves in the course of its development, I was pleasantly surprised. However, I'm still slightly disappointed by the safe and monotonous dry down, especially because of the potential shown by this surprising juxtapostion of two well realised accords. Nevertheless, I think it's worth at least sampling it, even if gourmand fragrances are not one's favourite genre and just for a fun olfactory experience.",

Here, it's slightly rubbery, exhibits a hay-like nuance and a subtle saffron hint as well, but at same time evokes a supple, velvety texture, much like suede. The plum and birch feel like natural complements to the suede. Not only do their olfactory profile overlap, the contrast between the lusciousness of plum and the austere, dry, phenolic aspect of birch enriches the whole suede/leather effect.\n\r\nThe fragrance turns slightly more resinous and more suave in the dry down, thanks to the immortelle rounding it off with its adorable honeyed warmth and smokiness. The sillage is rather close, while the longevity is around 8 hours.\n\r\nThroughout its development, Mont de Narcisse reminds me of Herm\u00e8s Cuir d'Ange and Givenchy Cuir Blanc. The former, because the suede note in both fragrances are quite similar, but the suede in Mont de Narcisse is not seen through an ethereal veil of heliotrope nor is it adorned by flickers of cumin like in Cuir d'Ange. Instead, it feels darker and more lavish. Meanwhile, my reminder of Cuir Blanc is mostly due to that both open with lightweight pepper and fresh bergamot, then focus on a suede note. But again, Mont de Narcisse appears richer in layers thanks to the supporting trio of plum, birch and immortelle, while Cuir Blanc chooses white musk to create a cleaner, more luminous effect. \n\r\nHowever, as much as I enjoy the overall suede fragrance that is Mont de Narcisse, I can't help but ask: \n\r\nWhere is the narcissus?\n\r\nSure, the narcissus might have played a role in summoning a hay-like aspect to the suede note, but it doesn't appear as a clearly defined note any time during the entirety of its development on my skin, at least not in a way that I'm more familiar with, of the enticing juxtaposition of horse, barnyard, hay, green sap and white flowers. Instead, Mont de Narcisse is a suede fragrance through and through. A very lovely one for sure, but for a fragrance whose name literally translates to \"hill/mountain of narcissus\", I feel a prominent suede fragrance is not what I signed up for.\n\r\nAs a result, I'd refrain from recommending Mont de Narcisse as a narcissus fragrance, but rather a slightly balsamic and suave modern fruity suede fragrance.

The dry down feels split between the sweetness of the benzoin and guaiac and the incense-like dryness.  It\u2019s elegant: a semi-sweet nod to gourmands while mainly being non-gourmand and resin-dominant, providing really nice experience and a great first impression of the house.\n\r\nI give this high marks for the blend want to try it again after some time.  And while I wouldn\u2019t call it wholly unique, it hits different spots from other resinous fragrances.  The \u201cBig Red\u201d cinnamon chewing gum comparison is valid, at least for the opening, as it\u2019s an especially spicy experience for several minutes, in contrast to, say, MFK Grand Soir or  Fort & Manle Suleyman Le Magnifique in which their cinnamon aspect is less spicy but more consistent throughout, more akin to a \u201cbaked goods\u201d type of cinnamon.\n\r\nThe pricing is $165 for 50ml, manageable enough if it\u2019s something that you love but certainly less so if you\u2019re blas\u00e9 toward it, but it\u2019s not a loud performer, fine on longevity but moderate on projection.  As always, a dabber sample is far from ideal but I applied enough of it to have what I estimate to be a fairly good idea of performance, even after several hours of wearing.\n\r\nOverall, quite a nice resinous scent!\n\r\n8 out of 10",

Oud Extravagant exerts the car-crash fascination of a cheese-and-diarrhoea version of its star ingredient \u2013 in much the style of Xerjoff\u2019s Zafar. Such an inflammatory opening subsides into a more-encompassing leather facet to the oud, which is then joined by the twinkle of resins and some subtle sweetish vanilla. \r\nOud Extravangant\u2019s heart phase is its most compelling. It has an honesty to it, presenting a layered oud without too much embellishment \u2013 as time wears on, it reveals different aspects: a deep in-the-grain kind of woodiness, floral hints, dry saffron-like impressions, the cool, soapy mystery of cardamom, while remaining very much an oud. The drama of the opening resolves into this increasing complexity, which is also accompanied with increasing smoothness.\r\nHowever in the deep drydown, when the perfume drifts increasingly in a leather-amber direction, it feels like a significant segment of what made it special has sloughed off. \r\nIn the main, a luxurious foray with some serious price gouging to match. Oud Extravagant will disappoint those after whipped-by-Valkyries projection; I find its sillage perfectly adequate, but those used to more thrust from their ouds may disagree. \n",

			"content": "Ehhhhhh. I don't know...\n\r\nI wanted to give this one some time before reviewing it, as I'm really rooting for Hermes to get back on track with their men's releases, and furthermore I'm a huge fan of Terre d'Hermes in general, and want to see the line do well. The EDT and Parfum are two of my favorite fragrances of all time. From the jump, Eau Intense Vetiver sounded a little superfluous in my opinion, as the original Terre has plenty of vetiver in it to satisfy the need, and why add more of a note that's in an already perfectly balanced scent? But regardless, I was excited to get a bottle and see if it successfully added another dimension to the line. \n\r\nVetiver opens with a bitter, almost harsh grapefruit accord that's bracing and manages to grab your attention for better or worse. I decided I like this aspect of the opening, as it's fairly distinct, though it only lasts about 5 minutes before it recedes into the background. The vetiver then begins to develop, though quietly at first. For about the initial half hour to 45 minutes it's a reserved, middle the road vetiver, not too earthy but not grassy either. It's well done but not particularly interesting. But then around the hour mark, Vetiver Intense truly earns its moniker, as a dark, roasted, vetiver blossoms fully and completely envelopes the wearer in its warm, toasted cloud. It inflates persistently, strong and thick, occasionally hitting a synthetic note along the way. It could be the intensity, the almost searing quality of the roasted vetiver that lends this synthetic appeal, but I can understand why some people have mentioned it. But overall it's an interesting vetiver scent. It more ore less remains like this until it gradually fades away over the course of 8 to 10 hours.\n\r\nI think Eau is a good take on vetiver but I don't really think this was necessary to put out. The Terre line already features plenty of vetiver and it would have been interesting to see it pushed in another more daring dimension. While I don't think Eau Intense Vetiver detracts from the prestige of the line, it does little to add to it. I haven't had much of an urge to wear it since my initial two or three wearings, and I think that says something about its personality--neither particularly charming or compelling.

Rather than having the citrus notes overwhelm and almost drown out the vetiver as with TF Grey Vetiver, the citrus alongside the geranium, olibanum and amberwood in TdH gently tethers the vetiver with some sweetness and keeps it from straying into an unpleasant wilderness while still maintaining it as the dominant note. \n\r\nTdH Eau Intense Vetiver retains some of the DNA found in the original TdH offering, especially with the Sichuan pepper, though, to my nose, I find it far more nuanced and pleasing. The original simply doesn't smell nearly as fresh as TdH Eau Intense Vetiver with its somewhat decayed orange accord and stale woods. \n\r\nWhile Terre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense Vetiver seems to be a bit of polarizing scent among aficionados, it's a winner in my book and my preferred vetiver fragrance at the moment.

Most of her prior work in the masculine space has resulted in discontinued quirky collectables or cult classics from lesser-known houses but with Terre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense V\u00e9tiver (2018), she marries the signature top notes from original Terre d'Herm\u00e8s with a classic vetiver accord, softening the base a tad too so that vetiver can shine. The result of this effort is a vetiver that is ever-so-slightly fresher than classic Guerlain Vetiver (1961) but not on the same hesperidic level as Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (2009). Terre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense V\u00e9tiver pulls no punches with the vetiver quantity unlike the Tom Ford scent, which may narrow it's interest to only dedicated Vetiverites, but also helps make it stand apart from the mineralic patchouli and cedar which defines the dry down of the original Terre d'Herm\u00e8s. \n\r\nTerre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense V\u00e9tiver opens with the same bergamot and grapefruit as vanilla TdH, but that vetiver note comes roaring out of the middle loud and clear, clotheslining the top notes with thick, muscular green arms like the Incredible Hulk. Any doubts as to what this will dry like on skin vanishes now, and the most honest vetiver since the erstwhile Guerlain staple released more than half a century ago is revealed. There's a tad more citrus here than in the Guerlain vetiver, making this more leafy and less smoky, plus the absence of a tobacco note keeps Terre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense V\u00e9tiver from feeling like it needs to be worn in a drawing room or smoker's lounge. Geranium and pepper keep the vetiver note perky with a piquant attitude, so it floats above the \"amberwood\" compound base of ambroxan and norlimbanol. Unfortunately, the inclusion of the latter does mean there is a scratchy quality to the finish that make this a deal-breaker with vintage fragheads, but I think Herm\u00e8s keeps their classic lines alive with new flankers just for them anyway. Performance and longevity is actually better than modern takes on the venerable Guerlain thanks to it's eau de parfum-like concentration, so you'll get more miles from this one than you might expect.\n\r\nTerre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense V\u00e9tiver has a foot in the past and a foot in the future just like the original TdH, and likewise is a \"manly man\" smell that will appeal only to guys smelling it on other guys, also like the original. Strait guys will get complaints from the girlfriend or wife when they wear this, but their bro friends will always take notice of them, and the occasional guy who finds manly smells attractive, but I need not go there. This is a perfectly good substitute for the original for guys who don't like it, but do enjoy a good vetiver, and for guys who want a classic Guerlain Vetiver alternative that isn't discontinued or hard to find like the Carven or Givenchy varieties respectively. I give this a thumbs up as a good office or casual scent, and maybe for formal settings too because a vetiver this pure is always classy to my nose. Terre d'Herm\u00e8s Eau Intense V\u00e9tiver isn't terribly unique like a niche vetiver, but scratches the itch better than any other modern take on the grass so far. If this is the direction Christine Nagel plans to take Herm\u00e8s, I'm all on board for it. Good show.",

			"content": "One of the latest from the UK house Timothy Han Edition Perfumes is Against Nature.  It\u2019s a pungent green semi-fresh semi-spicy semi-metallic semi-ozonic blend.  Green is certainly the main descriptor, as it\u2019s not especially floral or citrus-laden, though florals especially feel like heavy contributors.  I feel like the first new notes stand out the most: pink pepper, lemon, juniper.  There are interesting (what I take to be purely imaginary) notes of metal and lacquer that underscore the acerbic quality of the fragrance.  It has some bite, at least on my skin, and in that respect, it\u2019s quite provocative.  Timothy Han\u2019s fragrances are generally provocative, if nothing else.\n\r\nAgainst Nature is an apt name with its contrasting elements: vegetables and a metallic lacquer quality that seems manmade and industrial.  There\u2019s a statement here that\u2019s boldly poetic, and this may be the most daring of his several editions, even considering the power of his earlier release On the Road, the artistry of which I greatly appreciate but still find the fragrance an unlikely one to reach for.  Against Nature is a step beyond, and it\u2019s challenging to wear for enjoyment, though I figure fans of both green and metallic fragrances will find intriguing takeaways from trying it out, though I find it a little bit difficult to enjoy this type of fragrance as anything except a project or some type of research, myself, as I\u2019m not especially a fan of green or metallic fragrances.  \n\r\nIt\u2019s pungent for several hours so I take its performance to be pretty good, even if not as loud as its predecessor On the Road.  With Twisted Lily selling out of it, Against Nature is now only sold at Luckyscent (in the US) to my knowledge at $170 for 60ml, roughly the standard pricing for the line to date, as their bottle sizes have remained consistent for the past few years.\n\r\n5 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Amouroud is for all intents and purposes a return to custom bespoke perfumery, consultation, and creation which originally launched parent brand The Perfumer's Workshop back in the 70's. However, since the original Perfumer's Workshop nameplate has long since shifted to creating and manufacturing pre-made compositions for sale like practically every other house (some under license), they also offer a line of Amouroud scents pre-bottled to be sold at boutiques or independent shops away from the Amouroud counters themselves. White Hinoki (2018) is one such endeavor from their non-oud \"White Woods\" line, and is honestly a good starting point as any for the would-be niche arm of The Perfumer's Workshop. I'll be honest here: I was neither expecting a niche line nor a return to bespoke perfumery from this brand, even if the latter was the concept that originally launched it, simply because they have dwelt far too long in the downmarket discounter brand circuit. Their perfumes, however well-done and high-performing as they are, sell for peanuts and too many people into niche perfume seem to care oh-so much about price tag and how it equates to quality that I figured such an upmarket return would for them be futile. In spite of this, the Amouroud line has managed to expand considerably in just the short amount of time it's been floating around, and evidently sells well enough to support some dedicated counters and pop-up shops, but that's still not accounting for taste in a market segment where the buyer is often as fickle as they are flush with dough.\n\r\nWith all that having been said, White Hinoki by Amouroud is a good example of what The Perfumer's Workshop can do when economics are removed from the perfumer's laboratory, pushing the already impressive reputation the house has with bang-for-buck perfumes and taking it to the next level, delivering even more bang when limited bucks are no longer a problem. Generally speaking, this is a woody floral chypre but it's also a tobacco scent, anchored by both an impression of the namesake hinoki wood, tobacco, labdanum, and a bourbon vanilla amber reminiscent of Balenciaga Pour Homme (1990). The opening is quite bright, peppery, sweet, and sharp. Ginger and white pepper mix with blood orange and plum, giving White Hinoki a juicy gourmand edge. The heart of heliotrope, cinnamon, and violet add a gentle round white floral element, further hitting home the name of the perfume as an appropriate one. The whole accord remains sweet and a bit boozy as the bourbon vanilla amber notes kicks in. There's no oud here so unlike the Balenciaga example, this doesn't get barnyard in any way, but the labdanum and tobacco do pull White Hinoki in a slightly more masculine direction near the end, even if the bulk of the wear reads feminine or unisex at best. The hinoki wood note here to me just smells like the usual mishmash of aromachems, so that's the one point of egress for critical attack upon the niche validity of the composition I can personally find, but on the whole this is nice and smells quality. Wear time is over 12 hours and projection can be monstrous with potent sillage, so there is undoubtedly value for dollar here to those who love performance, but the style for me comes across strictly romantic and good only for fall through spring in that context. In other words, this is far from a generalist kind of smell.\n\r\nAmouroud White Hinoki is an interesting sort of Tom Ford by way of Amouage type of vibe crafted by relative unknown perfumer Angelique Nadau, as it mixes Western stylistic values with Middle Eastern potency, richness, and bombast into a fragrance that is guaranteed to make a statement if nothing else. Fans of sweeter fruity floral interpretations of tobacco, or violet accords lacking the usual green leafy subtext may find favor in something odd like White Hinoki, and in general anyone who likes a perfume that doesn't easily fit into a gender classification or style will want to get their nose on this. Once more, you have to enjoy sweet and sharp smells to really get the most of White Hinoki, and I mean sweet in that 90's Bath & Body Works sort of way, not so much the unbearably thick ambroxan tonka mishmash that is associated with most sweet fragrances from the 2010's. The payoff for brave guys here is a slightly powdery, woody, rich boozy tobacco tone similar to a cleaned-up and more-effeminate Balenciaga Pour Homme, but I don't know how much the average \"bro\" will appreciate the fruity white florals on top of that, so this one is not for the YouTube \"fragrance army\" despite the unisex/masuline tagging it gets on various perfume sites. For everyone else, this is a unique if pricey chapter in the story of The Perfumer's Workshop in a weighty well-cafted bottle worth checking out for the average niche fan looking to try something different from the usual MFK or Byredo offerings. Thumbs up. ",

			"content": "Aptly named, this one starts off with a hot pepper vibe, so much, that it even made me sneeze, but that's ok! \n\r\nI love chili, paprika, hot pepper, or any variety of the note. Pink pepper brings in a fruity and sweet sort of nuance as it combines with a tonka like accord in the middle. The dry down is what kills it for me, as it's mostly an overkill of Norlimbanol. I do get some Iso E too, which keeps it a little bit balanced in the dry down, but the Norlimbanol's presence is more apparent. Casherman?? No Azzaro, let's call it what it is, Norlimbanol. An ingredient that ruins new fragrances all the time for me. \n\r\nHell, I would be much happier going back to the early 2010's where everything had a tonka/coumarin heavy dry down, than this fake woods crap! \n\r\nA Fragrantica reviewer says this smells like Taste of Fragrance. My guess is that's the only chili note he has smelled in a fragrance to make that comparison. Yes the chili note smells similar, but come on, it's chili, how many ways can it be done? It's a simple note that creates a smell that you can pretty much imagine before smelling it. ToF?? Nothing similar. ToF is world's better. This one smells more like the opening of 1881 Belle Notte, but not as dark. The mid gives off a Polo Red vibe, and the dry down, well.. if you've smelled any fragrance in the past 2 or 3 years, then you've smelled this. Norlimbanol out the WAZOO.\n\r\nI am pretty confident with my review. Simple, and gave some comparisons. Many don't mind the \"fake woods\" smell, but it grinds my gears, personally. So, should you buy this? Well, it's a good chili based fragrance, and I cannot deny that. The chili note has good longevity. The projection is adequate. You don't want a fragrance with a chili note to project real big, it's more of a personal note for you to smell, and maybe people in close proximity. They did good with its projection, keeping it bouncing off the skin, but still contained. At the current price $50-60 range, and being very limited in numbers, I think it's a fair price, if this is something you like. On a side note, it smells nothing like Azzaro pour Homme in any way, shape, or form. Although I love the bottle's in this series, the way they look, and think their names are appropriate. Others may expect them to smell like ApH, and they don't at all. None of them do, but especially not this one. That's a good thing though, as ApH with hot pepper sounds like a mistake waiting to happen. Perhaps these were meant to be layered? They are pretty linear, and have simplistic stages. Though other than capitalizing on the success of the great predecessor, I see no reason why they didn't give these their own branding.\n\r\nAs of now.. I give this a very hesitant thumbs up. Not something I normally do on fragrances with less revered dry downs. The dry down is usually the majority of what you smell. I like the top and mid so much, that 2 out of 3 warrants a thumbs up, but just slightly. I might purchase a bottle if I can find a good deal, but at the current 50-60 price, and already owning Taste of Fragrance, 1881 Belle Notte (actually sold this one as of now, because I don't like it enough), Piment Brulant, and Mercedes Benz Infinite Spicy. I don't really see the need for another chili fragrance in my collection, especially for paying, pretty much retail price.\n\r\nThis fragrance also reminds me of Spicebomb.",

Though lighter, it\u2019s not ephemeral at all.\n\r\nIt has a light abstracted neutral floral opening. The fig keeps it neutral, from going high-pitched or too floral. I got a cool clean iris powder note directly on applying that I liked a lot, because it smells like a high-quality iris. It disappears fairly quickly though. The opening is really more a muted smooth floral with a fuzz of accent from the pink pepper, giving the perkiness of an aldehyde (there may be some aldehydes, I\u2019m not sure, but it seems more in the character of a light pepper).\n\r\nAs it ages, the jasmine heart comes forward more - non-indolic, pleasant and light. The peony keeps the jasmine in check a bit, keeping it more neutral, which I like better. I usually find peony architectural and soulless, a little unmoving and inscrutable. Here I like what it does to the jasmine. Jason Wu still retains that jasmine prettiness, but takes it to a more sophisticated level. This isn\u2019t a Chanel sophistication, which wows you, but a balance and good interplay of notes with a sort of polish of smoothness. \n\r\nBecause it has a toned down, almost \u2018beige floral\u2019 quality, it\u2019s versatile.

Whether Jason Wu can stand up to the heavy burden of being compared to those two greats, I don\u2019t know, but they each bring to mind the others for me.\n\r\nThe musk of the drydown is a token nod, mainly a way to bring this fragrance to completion, acceptable and appropriate. It has a quality lacking in so many great perfumes now - a satisfying ending.\n\r\nThe picture Jason Wu is bringing to mind is being in the office of a friend of mine.

Lasts an age on skin although sillage and projection are round about average. \n\r\nLots of patchouli, vetiver, nutmeg and sandalwood. There is something in this juice that reminds me slightly of the Nasomatto range. Especially Duro & Pardon. It's that swamp like DNA. Anyway....Great for formal occasions when you really want to make a statement. Top quality ingredients with a sophisticated and almost artistic feel. \n\r\n10/10 ",

			"content": "I received a sample of this from a generous BNer last year and loved it from the first spray so after using every drop of my sample I had to buy a bottle and did so from the wonderful Jovoy in Mayfair. \n\r\nI could imagine this fragrance is hard to appreciate for the uninitiated especially if normally used to fragrances with some sweetness. There is hardly any here...but be patient. It opens dry and you will quickly reach for a glass of water to rehydrate. The quality is not in question at any point of the development and this is actually the best combination of vetiver and patchouli I have come across to date. It has plenty of depth and breadth. The blend creates a wonderfully dusty ghost note and texture of cacao and there is a hint of orange citrus but blended in as part of the whole with no separation. This fragrance is really all about the Javanese and Haitian vetivers, all spicy and dark with a smidge of earthiness and the patchouli in a supporting but essential role. Very masculine although sold as unisex.  \n\r\nThe fragrance feels serious and probably why the name Incident Diplomatique was chosen. Could imagine most wearers would use this in a formal or business setting but I happily wear this any which way I can and all year round. \r\nOnce into the drydown there is more of a woodsy amber quality with the sandalwood joining the party and bringing in some welcomed sweetness to lighten the mood. It also brings out more of the rich and opulent facets of this beautifully composed Eau de Parfum.  \n\r\nTo subdue some of the initial dryness I usually spray under clothing to allow the oils to heat quicker and blend with my skin oils. 3 to 5 sprays is plenty for any situation with the oily consistency helping. \n\r\nHaving tried the entirety of Jovoy\u2019s current lineup this is my unrivalled favourite easily edging out Private Label and Psychedelique.\n\r\nLongevity is ample at over 12 hours on my skin with projection falling into that perfect aura goldilocks zone. I highly recommend this especially to lovers of all things vetiver.\n\r\nA solid 10/10.\n\n\n",

Incident Diplomatique is as close as it comes to the smell of a campsite in the forest.  You've got a huge, dry grass note, sweetly smoky patchouli, and a diffuse sandalwood, all held seamlessly together and put into a bottle.  No flowers, no fruits.  Contrary to most vetiver fragrances, this one refuses to share the stage with citrus.  It's all about wood and grass.  Don't look for any sugar here -- unless you can detect the inherent sweetness in dried leaves and nutmeg.  Although it's described as unisex, is totally masculine.

Excuse me my broken english and non professionalism.\n\r\nIncident Diplomatique by Jovoy Paris is extraordinary, outstanding, radically 'masculine' scent without any sweeteness.

Olivina's Bourbon Cedar is unsophisticated minimalism done right, a very natural-smelling masculine scent that layers a fresh-cut cedar note over discernible bourbon. It's a combination that works quite well, and there's some not-too-sweet vanilla and smoke in there to fill in the gaps. The late drydown ends up having something of \"smoky cola\" vibe.\n\r\nIt's no triumph of perfumery, but it wears its rough edges well and makes for an interesting addition to the landscape of contemporary masculine scents. It is, in its own way, an heir to full-bodied 80s masculines like Jacomo de Jacomo, which may be a significantly more complex creation than Bourbon Cedar but still occupies a similar lane.\n",

			"content": "I recently made several purchases through the Alexandria line, after reading about their performance online.  Since the original scents can be rather pricey or are no longer produced, I wanted to see about the quality of these \"inspirations\". \n\r\nTo preface, I don't have any experience with Tom Ford's Plum Japonais, as it has been discontinued for some time-so I won't be able to give you a true comparison of the two fragrances.  This juice, however, opens strong: almost stringent-it's rather unpleasant on first blast. The oud overpowers on the first spray, but the plum quickly mixes in to make up the top prominent top notes. They mix together well.  Hints of amber and cinnamon remain steadfast in the background: it becomes a powdery-smokey scent after the first 45 minutes that leans masculine. The scent remains linear until it dies down some 4-6 hours later.  It is a dark fruity oud that dries down into a strong plum-I enjoy it!\n\r\nAs far as longevity, I rarely get more than 4-5 hours out of Tom Ford at its greatest moments (with the exception of Tobacco Oud), so this is easily within the same ballpark.  It does project strong, so I would take it easy on the sprays unless you want to overwhelm. I sprayed on 4-5 sprays and people did comment that it was strong.\n\r\nFor the price as of this review ($40 for 30 ML) I give it a thumbs up: I think it's a good cologne to have in your collection and can see it in both a professional and casual social situation. Certainly worth an add.\n\r\n7/10\n\n",

Any other note is completely lost on my skin, and I don't detect any of the florals. In fact, I find something akin to ambergris in the initial and mid phases, even though it's not listed. The accord reminds me of Ambra Mediterranea. Tiger's Nest is somewhat muted and flat, and within a few hours all that's left is the dry down of balsams, which is too quiet and soft. I feel this would have more nuanced, complex if the florals were more prominent, and there was a bit more separation of notes. As is the case with African Leather, Tiger's Nest thins out towards the dry down (though not exactly being a top note con job). \n\r\nHonestly, I find there are dozens of incense/amber fragrances that more convincing than Tiger's Nest. As for Bhutan, Dzongkha is far more evocative, apart from being a much more nuanced and interesting composition. \n\r\n2.5/5\n\r\nP.S.

			"content": "Tiger\u2019s Nest, one of the more recent entries from Memo Paris, is primarily a spicy resinous fragrance.  It opens with a very spicy blast, apparently a mix of saffron, absinthe, aldehyde, and lime, and I don\u2019t find it irritating but rather invigorating. The spiciness calms down fairly quickly into a dry down of mixed resins and florals, anchored by a base of vanilla.  \n\r\nI don\u2019t detect any florals in particular, though ylang ylang, osmanthus, and rose are each listed.  As for the resins themselves, it mainly feels like olibanum, though tolu balsam is listed as well, and in concert with the vanilla, there is a hint of creaminess to the dry down as it smoothens from the initial spicy blast.  Still, though, the spiciness remains a part of the fragrance hours into wearing it.\n\r\nI\u2019m really pleased by the fragrance overall, as it kind of comes off like a niche twist on a spicy men\u2019s designer scent that I\u2019ve smelled before, so it\u2019s both familiar and elegantly upgraded at the same time.  It performs pretty well, too.\n\r\nRetailing at $300 for 75ml at Luckyscent, Aedes, Neiman Marcus, and perhaps some other US outfits, it\u2019s nonetheless available in the same bottle size on FragranceNet for $162 if a 37% coupon is applied, nearly half off!  I don\u2019t regard it as quite as elegant as the Fort & Manle resins (Amber Absolutely, Forty Thieves, Suleyman Le Magnifique)  but it comes at a cheaper price, if nothing else.\n\r\nI\u2019d like to try this some more, myself, as I do feel it\u2019s a resinous scent that has spicy quirks that I\u2019m not accustomed to seeing.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Love Tuberose is one of my happiest blind buys.  It's too sweet (in the fabulous top at least) to be for everybody--which makes it good for me. \n\r\nIt opens with a blast of lightly indolic tuberose followed in just about one minute with a soprano sweet jasmine buoyed up by a jet spray of sugar.  My first wearing it made me blink a couple times and pull my head back--but now I know what's coming and I wish I could stand under a fountain of the stuff.  It really only takes about ten minutes to fall earthward, apparently splashing over a single vanilla pod on the way down, landing in airy rivulets of merging narcotic white to form a thick and cohesive coating. \n\r\nAs it progresses, I appreciate the creamy smoothness.  The jasmine relaxes while the tuberose thins. I get a very gently supportive undertone of vanilla. Zero powder. No sense of wood. Not a heavy cream, but perhaps half and half--worth noting here that sugar comes first and alone, with the cream arriving shortly after.  I am simultaneously relieved and disappointed.  It's over an hour into this fragrance and I only now feel I'm in the heart of it.  It maintains some sense I can only describe as adequate oxygen--I never feel suffocated.  There is never any sense, at all, of anything clinging to the back of my throat, no sensation of soap. At all. \n\r\nBut it still says tuberose. Clearly. How is this possible?\n\r\nIt's lasting a very long time, maintaining the balanced heart with fainter beats.  I regret my need for sleep, to miss the ending. On waking, the skin scent lingering is still a faintly sweet vanilla.\n\r\nThe name has more meaning to me now.  I had taken it as an invitation, finally, \"to love\" tuberose but now I feel it's the closing of a letter-- \n\r\nDear Shy, \n\r\nHere is the best version of myself, custom tailored to match your sensibilities.  Please forgive all the gagging failures.\n\r\nLove,\n\r\nTuberose",

			"content": "I quite like this one and knew it immediately, which is always a good sign. Starts off smoky but unlike many 'campfire perfumes' doesn't stay there, instead moving into a woody-cedar-guaiac with some spicy coriander. That is supposed to emulate burning embers, and I think it's successful. Relatively simple construct of just five ingredients according to a blurb on her website. The simplicity is part of the charm with this one though. It's warm and comforting, unlike some smokier perfumes which come across as dry and acrid. Reminds me of an old farmhouse, a bit musty from age but where a wood stove is always burning, with some aroma always emanating from the kitchen. A homey smell, in other words. \n\r\nAs a natural perfume it doesn't last forever, but then burning embers never do I suppose. After perhaps 3-4 hrs it becomes a skin scent and is gone altogether by eight. Worth checking out if you're partial to this type of perfume and can find it.",

The use of thyme, lavender and other Herbes de Provence gives it a serene dryness. The rosewood and sandalwood \u2013 and I would swear there is a bit of cedarwood in there as well \u2013 intensify the dryness.  The bergamot and lemon would not be strong enough in and of themselves to continue the citrus top through the experience, so I believe there is also a strong neroli note as well. At least my nose tells me so. It is crisp and bold and bright.\n\r\nThe vanilla makes its appearance towards the end of the dry down. As an eau de cologne it is not long lasting, but impresses with that wonderful and fragrant herbal dryness mixing with the refreshing citrus notes.\n\r\nThis was created for Isabella II, mother of King Alfonso XII of Spain in 1880. It was quite popular among other members of the Spanish royal family and was finally made available to the public in 1890. It was still in production in 1941, but did not survive the war years.\n\r\nIt is surprising that Guerlain would name it such. Hegemonienne is difficult to spell, pronounce, and most importantly, remember \u2013 a handicap from a marketing standpoint.\n\r\nA real rarity, but thankfully still available now and then from private sellers.

You have to really look hard to find the oud note and I don't detect anything purple at all so the name is a question as to its references but it fits the overall scent somehow. This oud is probably the same note used in Leather Oud and Oud Ispahan, but in a greatly subdued capacity.  After a few hours the clean opening gives way to this lightly toasted oud spice wood base with hints of pepper, cumin and touch of patchouli in the background.  Purple Oud starts mild, smoothe and engaging but evolves into an inward looking oud cooled down with a touch of clear patchouli.  Purple Oud is a \"cool cat\" kind of scent.

While it is centered around fig, the fig isn't so strong and direct as to totally make this a fig fragrance. It's less \"figgy\" than scents like Philosykos, Premier Figuier, and Figuier Eden, which focus purely on the fruit and little else. Balade Sauvage blends fig with other fruity notes as well, perhaps pear, apricot, and peach among others. It also incorporates soft tropical floral notes and blends them with the fruit, creating a scent that fresh and tropical but also kind of warm. There's a definite comfortable warmth that accompanies the fruit and floral notes and it comes across very smooth and natural feeling. Some citrus notes provide a little edge as well, but they're not particularly strong or sharp, so you never feel like you're wearing a citrus fragrance exactly. Labdanum in the base ensures a very smooth, plush finish. Balade Sauvage is never screechy, synthetic feeling, or anything other than unisex. Overall the quality is great and the performance is solid with good projection and longevity. It has a casual appeal, but would be very easy to wear a little dressed up as well. I would rate this a 9/10 easily, with perhaps the chance to give it another half a point once I have a little more time with it.\n\n",

Neroli for sure to be more specific.\n\r\nTo me, the opening was very reminiscent of Creed's Jardin D'Amalfi, even through the opening and into the heart notes. The major difference being the gorgeous floral musky drydown of Jardin D'Amalfi complimenting the citrus where as Balade Sauvage stayed more linear, at least on my skin.\n\r\nThough I sit in the midst of Winter as I write this review, this would be an absolutely beautiful Spring into Summer scent as pleasant a smell on a gentleman or a lady - a fragrance this fine discerns no gender.\n\r\nHaving received this as a small complimentary sample courtesy of Dior for ordering Dior Leather Oud (quite a different direction on that needless to say) I certainly may consider picking this one up.\n\r\nLongevity on my skin was a satisfactory 6-7 hours, having moderate sillage, as i could smell it off my wrist well into the 3 hour mark until about 5 hours in when the projection began fading.\n\r\nCertainly full bottle-worthy in terns of quality, however as is the case for all blends of the esteemed Priv\u00e9e line, price is certainly up there, so to the buyer be the decision.\r\nAnd of course, due to the polarity of neroli, I certainly advise sampling before making any purchase!\n\r\nMay you all have a pleasant evening!",

It's plenty sweet but not over the top, and the sharpness of the cocoa powder is somehow there.  Another similar analogous experience is the smell of a milk chocolate bar when first being unwrapped. A brilliant capture by Sarah.\n\r\nThe praline/hazelnut mix starts to emerge in the background quickly after application.  Hazelnut alone is more familiar, and I like to think I would've pointed it out without knowing about it ahead of time, but the addition of praline makes for a more nuanced and alien blend, albeit very desirable and certainly not taking much away from the cocoa-dominance of the fragrance.\n\r\nI can't really pick out the coffee and vanilla individually but certainly they could, respectively, enhance the sharp and sweet touches of the fragrance.\n\r\nOverall, I'm delighted that Over the Chocolate Shop gives me something new, slightly unexpected, and not just a near-copy of another chocolatey gourmand I've smelled before.\n\r\nThe \"dry cocoa powder\" aspect of it makes it unique among the chocolate fragrances I've smelled, and as often, I'm impressed by how polished the finished product is.\n\r\nIt's definitely a standout entry in the 4160 Tuesdays lineup and an all-star gourmand, a must-try for gourmand lovers, especially lovers of cocoa.\n\r\nIn addition, it performs very, very well, I dare say exceptionally, even among other similar cold-weather-leaning fragrances in the house that are generally strong, its dark juice selling its strength fairly convincingly.  Its boastful projection of a few feet for at least a couple hours followed by a good scent cloud thereafter, suggests high value.\n\r\nFortunately, the pricing is rather in line with most of her offerings, at $110 for 50ml, and is sold in the US at Luckyscent.\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'm dazzled.  Over the Chocolate Shop is a fragrance that I smell and want to keep smelling over and over again, among my favorite of Sarah's creations.  Bravo!\n\r\n8 out of 10",

The savory aspect which can certainly be compared to celery is also very like the herb lovage, a common ingredient of soups. It could come also from angelica roots which is listed among the ingredients, and is a characteristic component of gin of course, which is in keeping with the backstory. \n\r\nYou could end up smelling like a soup kitchen but somehow the perfumer pulls if off and just makes a fascinating and creative blend, very avant garde and different from anything else on the market, that I'm aware of.\n\r\nThe dominant effect for me of this excellent fragrance in summary is savory and herbal.  It is earthy and rooty. I don't think it is at all animalic and any association with sweat, prostitution and debauchery is ridiculous.

			"content": "Bravanariz is Juniper Ridge on steroids, a super-hyped Spanish version of the American brand. Not so much perfumery as communing with nature, proudly going beyond the industry\u2019s regulations to bring you the real ale of the fragrance world.\n\r\nYou know the pitch: forsaking all petrochemicals and horrid synthetics, we don our hiking boots and head for the wild mountains with a couple of jam jars, a few tin cans and a bit of lab glassware to make it look convincing, returning with the very essence of mother nature, all without harming a single microbe. \n\r\nExcept Bravanariz outshines even Juniper Ridge with their passion and inspiration. \u201cOur bottles not only contain the essence of a place but all the experiences lived in it\u201d, they explain. How amazing, and it\u2019s all put together by honest folk who hate technology but love plants.  It sounds so appealing that you want to buy everything straight away. But hang on, what does their stuff actually smell like?  \u2026. \n\r\nWell that\u2019s a different story. Judging by this particular product they probably smell like the amateur concoctions they are. Cala is rather a crude fennel odour which does improve with time, but that\u2019s probably because it disappears with time. \n\r\nHowever, don\u2019t dismiss this brand out of hand. A few of their rarer offerings are excellent, original scents. Made for them, possibly, by a firm that knows what it\u2019s doing. Stil never mind that, if you find one you like just enjoy it alongside the advertising and take no notice of cynical people like me.\n\r\nOf their wild, IFRA-noncompliant \"Olfactory Digressions\", I would single out FUM, a very interesting and compelling scent recalling old wooden boats and railway stations during the steam era. There is also Pi, a pine variant suggestive of machine rooms with electric motors and a touch of WD40 in the air. Pi is an ultra volatile topnote which is gone almost as soon as it hits the smelling strip.\n\r\nMy above reservations aside, I take my hat off to any firm with the guts to market such singular fragrances.\n",

			"content": "Despite being a caffeine fiend, coffee is not my thing. It makes me nauseous. If an estate agent were to take me to a house smelling of the stuff (a common sales trick, I am told), I\u2019d be inclined to walk right back out the door. But being an Auphorie follower, I felt I couldn\u2019t avoid trying this even if it threatened  to be a S\u00e9cr\u00e9tions Magnifique-type experience for me. Maybe the iris would save it, but then No 15, their other perfume supposedly centred around iris hadn\u2019t really delivered on that promise. \r\nWell, after much dithering, there was nothing else to do but press that sprayer\u2026\r\nAnd sure enough a basso profundo ogre\u2019s-breath coffee top note spewed out \u2013 uncompromisingly bitter, caramelized/burnt, deep in the grounds and yet with a certain almost-milky smoothness. This stuff was oceanic and for coffee lovers it is bound to be a head rush. Curiously, much as I dislike coffee, none of the associated nausea was materializing. I was surprised at how mellow and indulgent this was feeling, addictive even, prompting me to go for another spray. Iris Macchiato, while still undoubtedly about the espresso, seemed to get creamier and rounder all the time, and I wondered whether this effect was the result of the benevolent working of the musk.  \r\nThis was the beginning of a long, slow transition, with first the perfume\u2019s throw getting a temperate  chocolate aspect, airborne and light, before increasing abstraction with gentle woody and sweetish tones coming into play. Once again, I felt the iris was proving elusive to my nose  until it dawned that this delicate woody sweetness is the Auphorie interpretation of this note. \r\nWhat can I say? This is an expertly blended perfume. If it can give a coffee hater like me a good ride, that\u2019s saying something about the craft involved here. \n",

The \"funeral flowers\" note -- carnation, as astutely pointed out by Shycat -- is the loudest voice in the opening, but doesn't really get to its crescendo right off the rip.

As far as the smell of a funeral home during a viewing...I'd say that this is a pretty good representation.\n\r\nThe benzoin and incense give it a warm backdrop, though it does eventually lose that warmth, becoming, in my opinion, very similar to the scent of an empty funeral home.

Smolder-smack-smolder-smack. Just as the tension starts to fade, nauseatingly creamy florals with a touch of indolic moth-ball shimmer emerge from the opening violence.

The most logical comparison when smelling it in the first time was Imaginary Authors A City on Fire, due to their common smoky/burning focus and generous use of cade oil as a key note. It's surely more of an intense burning experience than ACOF, to put it modestly, as ACOF by comparison smells more animalic than burning, with T-Rex being the clearly more burning-focused scent.  In that respect, T-Rex feels a little more one-dimensional but I imagine those seeking a more intense burning leather, almost barbecue-smelling sort of scent will find in T-Rex a creative offering that might suit them well.\n\r\nOverall the composition feels like it's roughly half made up of cade, with the other half coming from leather, black pepper, and patchouli.  Not infinitely complex but not at all boring, either.\n\r\nIt's a superior performer, on the high end of projection, particularly for its first couple hours, and especially longevity.\n\r\nThe value in T-Rex is palpable, though--it's a very strong fragrance in extrait concentration, and $175 for 60ml is a reasonable-enough price if one very much likes or even loves it.\n\r\nStill, I'd give ACOF the nod over T-Rex fairly easily.  It takes something of T-Rex's audacity to put ACOF in perspective, as, at the time of its release, I thought of ACOF perhaps in the same terms in which I regard now regard T-Rex.  Go figure.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

It settles down, eventually, but my first test spritz lasted all day with strong projection and a very masculine tone.   Black Pepper, nutmeg, cade smoke, with patchouli gives the leather of T Rex a prickly abruptness that while bold and very much an outdoorsman in character also brings soft inner depth from sueded osmanthus, expanding rose, quiet of champaca, mellow ylang, and sparkling sandalwood.  The leather here reminds me of Mona di Orio's Cuir but not quite as bold and much easier to wear.   Built into this prehistoric big fella is a huge personality but also a soft inner depth that makes it very enjoyable to wear. ",

			"content": "YBRY \u2013 DESIR DU COEUR (1927)\n\r\nYbry, a company based in both Paris and New York City, existed from 1925 to 1944. They produced 22 scents, according to the Perfume Encyclopedia. They boasted being the world\u2019s most expensive perfumes, due to the quality of their ingredients.\n\r\nThey are most noted for their stunning Baccarat designed Art Deco bottles, squares in colored crystal with canteen like openings on a top corner. These are highly collectible, with or without contents intact. Lalique also created bottle designs for Ybry.\n\r\nPerfumista Alexandra Star tells us that: \u201cEach different color, was related to a particular perfume, and to a different gem. The colors range from a red to a pink, slag green to a darker green, jet black, orange to butterscotch, deep purple to lavender. Most of the time, the bottles had matching enameled and gilded metal covers. These covers were placed over the inner stoppers at an angle on one corner of the bottle.\u201d\n\r\nDesir Du Coeur is described as a feminine floral similar to Chanel #5.\n\r\nTop Notes: Bergamot, Ylang Ylang, Neroli, Lemon\n\r\nHeart Notes: Jasmine, Lily of the Valley, Orris, May Rose\n\r\nBase notes: Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber, Patchouli, Vetiver\n\r\nThe blending of these simple ingredients, present in so many perfumes of the 1920s, is masterly. No one note stands out. All blend seamlessly into a beautiful whole. It does strike me as being somewhat similar to Chanel No. 5, but there seem to be no animalics in the base, which sets it apart from the Chanel. Without these elements, Desir becomes primarily a floral m\u00e9lange, lighter than the Chanel, but just as beautiful.\n\r\nMy partner describes it as a warm, slightly spicy floral, based in his nose on a jasmine/rose/ orris accord, rounded and pushed forward by the subtle citruses, grounded by the patchouli, which gives it a sensual and mysterious undercurrent.\n\r\nDesir du Coeur\u2019s subtlety is one of its most charming qualities. Understated, elegant and sophisticated, it is thankfully still available from private sellers on the Internet.  Very worth seeking out.\n\n",

			"content": "While many Slumberhouse fragrances are incredibly complex, consisting of many moving parts and shapeshifting tendencies, Sixes in comparison seems fairly dialed-in and focused, a fairly singular presentation of a warm, spicy sandalwood with cozy and comfortable animalic facets and a buttery, leathery texture. What immediately struck me about Sixes is its warmth--the sandalwood accord (which drives the heart of the fragrance) is ensconced in a very much living, warm-blooded musk,  and such its presence is deep and rich, the olfactive equivalent of a fur coat or soft winter blanket.  In my experience, Sixes avoids the more off-putting facets of animalics. While there's certainly a touch of funk among the musk, and the fragrances is literally pulsating with vibrant, living heat, the really sultry elements and strong barnyard components are, for the most part, absent.  In turn, Sixes & Sevens is a comfortable and easy wear, and it feels like it could be appropriate in a variety of situations.  \n\r\nThe sandalwood seems to be of a high quality. I find it has a buttery, luxurious texture, cloud-like at times though altogether very deep and present.  One of the interesting things about Sixes is how the sandalwood develops, and over time it seems to become much drier and takes on a fiery intensity at times. I was also reminded of Gucci Pour Homme while wearing this. A smell similar to GPH's signature bold \"pencil shavings\" accord is at play here, perhaps even more waxy at times, but delivering much of the same dusty rawness as the original.  \n\r\nMy experience with Sixes & Sevens so far has revolved around 2 interesting developments and changes that occur during its course: To begin, there is a curious element of heat in this  composition. I find that Sixes begins with a very comforting human warmth, and that it persists in this for some time, but then it gradually becomes hotter as the composition becomes drier. The heat can get to very intense levels, almost as if a fire is occurring in its heart, and as the heat intensifies and really begins to cook, a smokey component joins the sandalwood which is now dry and desiccated.  This transition regarding the heat occasionally goes back and forth. Things will seem to cool down for a moment only for the fire to catch again until everything's burning with a hot intensity. The other interesting development that I've already alluded to is the \"dryness\" of the wood. Though Sixes begins with a very cozy warmth, it's a deep, alive sort of feeling that's soft and reassuring. The sandalwood is creamy, waxy, and buttery. But once the heat kicks in, it's like it saps the composition of all of its moisture. The sandalwood becomes extremely desiccated (as does the fragrance in general) and we are left with heat and smoke, almost as if a forest has been burned to the ground and all that remains is scorched earth. And it still smells good. \n\r\nI really enjoy this fragrance overall. I like the fact that it's dialed in. Everything works together seamlessly and all the parts seem to operate with a singular, unified purpose. The fragrance itself smells very nice. It's a great woody composition to wear in these colder months. It would be perfect for a cold December night around the fire, and it doesn't really contain any off-putting, controversial elements that could otherwise ruin the enjoyment of wearing it or turn other people off from wanting to be close to you. At the same time, it's an interesting, dynamic composition. I haven't smelled a sandalwood this good in a long time, and the animalic components, particularly the musk, lend a very luxurious and rich dimension to its quality. Before becoming fiery hot and bone-dry, Sixes feels like donning an expensive furl-lined leather jacket or some kind of alluring fur coat. Performance is just as it should be--slightly stronger than mid-range projection and stellar longevity.  One of my favorite Slumberhouse releases in a while, hopefully Sixes & Sevens will see a second release at some point in the future. If it doesn't, I'm sure glad to have gotten a bottle while it was available. ",

			"content": "This latest limited edition release from Slumberhouse, Sixes & Sevens, is, as many have said, not as boastful as their typically beastly and provocative dark juice. Josh Lobb's house does feature lighter and brighter options (consider Sadanne, Pear + Olive, Grev, and perhaps even Kiste) but what I've come to love the house for is its dark, potent, pungent offerings that I tend to adore for their performance and appropriateness in winter (i.e. Norne, Ore, Jeke, Zahd, Sova).\n\r\nSixes & Sevens mainly smells of leather and resins (benzoin, frankincense), with hints of castoreum, orris, cumin, sandalwood, and oud each adding some intrigue.  Among these background players, castoreum is what I notice most, though it's used in such restrained quantity as to not jeopardize the prominence of leather being the principal accord and resins being the backup singers.\n\r\nAs some have reported, and I now concur, the fragrance is a bit less daring and significantly less intense, in terms of performance, than most of the Slumberhouse catalog to date, and that's not to say that that wasn't wholly Josh's intention.  In this respect, it's a departure from the norm, perhaps allowing for a more agreeable, more versatile option that can be enjoyed on more occasions throughout more seasons.\n\r\nI get only modest projection for the opening hour, and it becomes a skin scent, albeit steadily so, within a couple hours of applying.  Certainly it still feels comparably as strong as other niche wintery offerings, but its contrast to other dark juices in the house is palpable, performance-wise.\n\r\nThe elephant in the room, though, is the pricing, $200 for 30ml (contra the usual $160 for 30ml) with an additional option of $500 for 100ml, of which all bottles of both sizes sold out almost immediately anyway, meaning that it can only be obtained via the secondary market at predictably-inflated pricing.  Given the diminished performance of the juice, Sixes & Sevens is a tougher sell at its retail pricing, limited edition status notwithstanding.\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sixes & Seven is good, perhaps very good, and if I'd gotten in on blind buying a bottle via the house directly (I would've opted for a 30ml for $200), I would keep it and enjoy it, but I'm not all that inclined to track it down for $200 (or realistically, much more) given that it does not push the envelope like most of the fragrances in the catalog, and though these fragrances set perhaps an unrealistically high bar to keep reaching over and over again, it's the selling point for the juice: powerful, provocative potions, pardon the alliteration.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

The top is the best. Incense+animalics+sweet resins. Loved it.\r\nBut into the heart phase the cumin note became way too prominent for me. Since this was not consensus here I sprayed a few more spritzes to get rid of juice in the tube. Now I find it much more balanced. The top that I liked continues throughout. The cumin is there but in background. For those who did not like it the first time I would recommend trying it a couple more times before making up your mind.\r\nThere is a hint of oud at the back which is hidden up top by incense and cumin. I suppose the cumin-oud-musk combo can be called leather (Dior's Leather Oud).\r\nTo me it is predominantly an incense+cumin+resin fragrance.\n\r\nWhat I like the most here is the balance and blending. Very unlike his others (Norne,Baque, Sova) I sampled. \r\nBottomline: Great fragrance. A bit too pricey. 4 stars",

			"content": "Simply one of the veritable best takes on spicy/musky roses out there. If you appreciate cardamomish floral fragrances a la Cartier Declaration or Declaration d'un Soir go no further without missing this take from Urban Scent. Desert Rose just provides a sort of unisex version of that type of spicy/rosey concept with the addition of a gentler (which does not mean softer) sexy musky-chic feminine spark. Musk is the king in here alongside cardamom, spicy rose and something else kind of leafy-floral (could b\u00e8 lily of the valley or something different, geranium?). The floral element is intensely indolic, acid, kind of fizzy, musky and grassy all at once. Spices (mostly airy ginger, cardamom and cloves under my profane nose) are dry (yes peppery) but kind of penetrating, juicy and pungent at same time. I even detect the soapy/leafy (dry floral) rosey twist a la Perris Montecarlo Rose de Taif. I've read somewhere that Salicylic acid (one of listed patterns) is found in essential oils and as a plant hormone in the leaves, blossoms and roots of various plants, unfolding a sort of pleasant minty-aromatic (vaguely hesperidic) odor, which can be definitely perceived in here (as a sort of grassy aromatic vibe). The name of this scent is inappropriate imo since this rose is other than fully arid, being on the contrary something finally velvety, vivid, botanical, sparkling and chic (with its musky-floral kind of soapy spark). Cardamom finally emerges in all its musky splendor (vaguely reminiscent of cardamomish beasts a la Cartier Declaration or Frapin L'Humaniste). Desert Rose Is ideally a sort of olfactory encounter among urban spicy roses a la D\u00e9claration d'un Soir and the romantic Mf Kurkdjian Lumi\u00e8re Noire PH's rosey woody/aromatic rendition. A perfect unisex rosey scent for a  globetrotter edonist who wanna leave a trail.",

			"content": "Vetiver R\u00e8union represents my first approach with Urban Scents, an indipendent Berlin-based niche laboratory alchemically processing pure ingredients yet harvested and handcrafted by independent little manufactories. Passion for pure ingredients and nature as vehicle our mind to be conveyed in to a sort of senses-journey seems to be the main imput for the creative work of the talented perfumeur Marie Urban - le Febvre. As regards the fragrance itself I can say Vetiver R\u00e8union is neither a tipically grassy nor a purely earthy sort of vetiver, this is basically an urban refined \"liquid-peppery\" realistic vetiver quite melancholic, metropolitan and definitely saturnine. Introvert lovelorn men of the asian megalopolis (perfectly groomed in their minimalistic dark sleek starched styles) should sublimate their ghosty souls as encompassed by such an enigmatic aroma. Pepper is absolutely noticeable along the top stage, quite prickly, wet and vibrant. It is the perfect complement for a musky/woody vetiver sliding towards a musky smoother alley. The vetiver's soul is smooth and super realistic (kind of \"fragrant\", rounded and musky) but the \"long tailed\"  scent's fluidity provided by peppery woodiness renders the aroma sharper, damper and more assertive. A tad of muskiness finally rounds and soothens this moody edgy alchemy from the dark forest indeed. Scents a la Lalique Encre Noir (as ideally combined with Jacobs Bang and the damp l'Erbolario Ginepro Nero) jump vaguely on mind along the journey. The juice is not particularly rich or articulated but is definitely solid and realistic (the note of vetiver is actually intense, natural and exotic). I detect a sense of mystery and urban loneliness conjuring me vaguely an Haruki Murakami's typical metropolitan scenario from his masterwork 1Q84. Recommended especially for the lovers of the dominant raw material (an intense vetiver).",

A tad of citrus introduce the botanic valzer. Osmanthus and magnolia (immediately heady in a general musky dimension) elicit a particularly leafy, herbal, restrained and bitter-lymphatic aristocratic aura. While osmanthus smells more properly \"aqueous\", \"silent\" and transpatent magnolia is royal, acid-leafy, languid, moody and victorian. There is a sort of victorian atmosphere all around the wearer. Musk, patchouli, a tad of soapiness and jasmine provide a finally chic (more \"urban\") sophisticated spark  (the contemporary side of the moon). Along the way the aroma becomes even more rounded, soapy, warm and elegant (in a modern urban-glamour way - in this stage it seems to detect hints of tobacco as in the vintage D&G ph formula). The whole olfactory level is convincing and solid since this fragrance is well balanced, at same time retr\u00f2 and avant-garde, polished and versatile, fresh and warm.

This secret marine vibe is evident under my profane nose, smelling salty, freshy and vaguely musky-talky (in a way full of light and spaciousness).

I find that it obtains an interesting middle-ground between ashy/smoky and fresh/bright.  I wouldn\u2019t really call it fresh at all, but it\u2019s not a smoke monster (shout out to fans of Lost).\n\r\nIt opens with a pungent sharpness, the top notes of ginger and rhubarb no doubt facilitating this effective, with a heart of vetiver, drying down to a balanced blend of cedar, patchouli, and leather.  Really, though, the blended vetiver heart tells most of the story as a sort of nod to Ernest Hemigway\u2019s tenure in the Caribbean.  I do not typically associate vetiver with the tropics, even though that\u2019s where it comes from, since it feels like a suitable fragrant ingredient for the colder weather, but the same can be said of a lot of organisms that grow in hotter areas but whose yield nonetheless seems more apt for colder weather (i.e. coffee, chocolate, vanilla, oud).\n\r\nMy vetiver knowledge is far from extensive, but it\u2019s far more to the ashy side along the lines of Lalique Encre Noire than to the fresher side like Guerlain Vetiver, though that\u2019s a gross oversimplification.  Surely this strikes me as a vetiver for vetiver fans, however, and fans of vetiver will love it and those less familiar with vetiver may be confused by it.\n\r\nHemingway is an immersive vetiver experience, somewhat intense but not overwhelming.  It performs very well, though, a significant scent cloud coming from a few fairly minor sprays from the sample atomizer, but its cost, $145 for 35ml, even with the beautiful presentation, indicates that, like most of the line, you should sample it and love it before buying.  I personally find it to be a fun fragrant experience though I know that I tend to reach for vetiver fragrances very seldom (I\u2019ve a few: Guerlain Vetiver, Roja Vetiver Extrait, and Lalique Encre Noire a la Extreme).\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "The opening is a mixed bag - there's a a stunning neroli note that's been turned inside out so that it smells (initially) more like the bitter tonic water you add to a G&T and less like the bathroom soap neroli usually turns into on my skin, but it shares the room with a rough Iso E Super or plain lumberyard woody chemical that I just can't stand. Immediately past the topnotes, the bullish woody note flattens its ears just enough to let the golden neroli slide past and occupy center stage. The neroli is like that badly behaved little cousin of yours who manages to keep up a good show for all of five minutes before lapsing into his default mode of being a little shit, i.e., it suddenly drops all its white t-shirty, summery G&T freshness and turns into, well, you guessed it, a bar of bathroom soap. Sadly, this gives the screechy woody aromachemical permission to return, so the rest of the scent is really just cheap neroli guest bathroom soap duking it out with woody ethanols. If you like a natural-smelling neroli or orange blossom scent, you can get it in half litre bottles in any Southern European country (not just France). At over 150 euros, Thomas Kosmala is brazenly up-charging (call it niche snob tax if you like) for the addition of some Iso E Super sloshed into neroli supermarket cologne.   ",

The agarwood in this falls by the wayside in the dry down. Yes it\u2019s apparent but Qafiya is all about a dominating ylang, white musk and amber through and through until the end, days later.\n\r\nVery complex. The opening to this Qafiya is to die for with the saffron. Apparently this was modeled after the way that the Dubai mall smells according to a reviewer on Parfumo but in my opinion, it\u2019s for sure super opulent and incredibly strong for hours and hours in the usual Ajmal manner that \u2018maybe\u2019 smells like a mall but to my nose this smells like a super heavy dense amber perfume for women that I swear smells like the Cher perfume because there\u2019s so much ylang in this.\n\r\nI seriously love this perfume that was purchased blind for my birthday by my amazing Mom simply for the reason that I\u2019m smitten over Ajmal\u2019s Exotic Amber that uses the same exact base notes. To my dismay, blending is a bitch apparently because I was expecting heavy base notes of oud and amber. This for sure smells like an exquisite mall in a sense spritzed with perfume and just that... \u2018perfume\u2019. I still cannot believe that this was made in commemoration of the late Sheikh Zayed and is supposed to be for dudes. This to my nose leans so far feminine that it\u2019s ridiculous, not even exaggerating.\n\r\nThis reminds me of Cher\u2019s perfume, the one from the 80\u2019s, for real. It\u2019s the first thing that had popped into my brain. I\u2019ll tell you that the oud in this is exquisite that unfortunately fades away into ylang and a piercing white musk note in the very long end so the oud here is minimal.\n\r\nNuclear. This requires a few \u2018drops\u2019. Not atomized. This scent is very, very strong with heavy sillage. Super unique odor that clearly to my nose belongs on a Woman and my God will she smell intoxicating.\n\r\nI\u2019m sad over this. The flacon and presentation is top along with this smell but alas, Qafiya year of Zayed is for girls who love leaving a heavy and intoxicating wake of yellow flowers, amber  and white musk.

The cedar, muskette, and elemi are there in the background, playing softly to bolster the composition.  It is strong, but not as strong as the Silk or Satin extraits in my opinion.  Longevity and projection rates a third in both.  But, that being said this still rates as a good performer, just never quite reaching nuclear status.  Probably the least feminine of the MFK ouds I have tried.  Wearable and interesting.  ",

I ordered the decant after seeing a split and was intrigued.\n\r\nIn point of fact, its name is accurate, though it feels like a bit more berry than tobacco. It\u2019s playfully fruity, almost like  Bath & Body Works product, rather than being bold and boundary-pushing, and in that respect it\u2019s an easy wear, very unisex, and not terribly challenging.  Still, there\u2019s something synthetically fruity about it that doesn\u2019t quite match my expectation.\n\r\nThe relatively simply note breakdown of berries, vanilla, sandalwood, and tobacco seems about right, though there might be a slightly floral aspect to it.  It\u2019s not a bad fragrance at all; it\u2019s quite pleasant, in fact, but simply fails to dazzle much at all, and at $160 for 50ml, I\u2019d need a little more to want a lot more of this than the 5ml decant that I have.\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s decent but not great.\n\r\n6 out of 10\n",

In an unusual move for the time, many of the scents created by the house during the first half of the 20th century were designed for men.\n\r\nMimosa is a difficult scent to find today in an unsullied form. One really has to look at vintage sources for this enigmatic soliflore. Two of the best I have found are those by Tuvache and the original Molinard formula \u2013 the latter\u2019s current offering bears no resemblance to the original or to the flower\u2019s scent itself.\n\r\nThe aroma is sweet, woody, and vegetative with intensely tenacious leafy violet heart notes. The scent is honey soft, violet sweet, a floral with delicate green undertones. It is one of the most animalic of florals with its warm, honeyed center reminiscent of body warmth and intimate moments.\n\r\nD\u2019Orsay\u2019s offering is extremely true to the flower\u2019s scent. Amazing to see all the notes that are included as they support and never intrude. Mimosa is always center stage. Along with the Tuvache and Molinard original, this is one to seek out for all lovers of vintage soliflores.\n\n\n",

Up close it is very green and true to the scent of vetiver. At a distance a cloud of floral and herbal notes walk with the wearer, the vetiver still at the center.

			"content": "Le Labo Tonka 25 is probably the first release I can remember (since fragrances became a hobby) being quite excited for, certainly of the main collection, if not the City Exclusives as well.  Tonka is a fun note and is central in some fragrances that I love--particularly, deeply rich and sweet gourmand fragrances--so naturally, I was curious to see what Le Labo did with it.\n\r\nTonka 25 does not seem like it'd be an opulent gourmand, though, from the note breakdown list, and the actual scent confirms this prediction.  In addition to the eponymous note of tonka, sweet and subtly nutty, there are strong contributions from cedar and musk, rendering the blend, fittingly, woody and musky.  The musk is definitely of the \"sweet white musk\" variety, not animalic, and the cedar makes a fitting partner for a smooth, easy dry down, an easy partnership of sorts.\n\r\nIn the dry down, it's darker, as well, the musk fading with the tonka actually becoming heavier and more enveloping, rendering the fragrance even more comforting as a whole.\n\r\nAs with most higher-end brands, Le Labo's increasing pricing makes, with each year, for more challenging decisions of the value and merits of its fragrances.  The saving grace is that the main collection (contra the city exclusives) is sometimes discounted by store-wide coupons (at, for example, Saks Fifth Avenue), so there's some relief.  The retail pricing of Tonka 25 is $270 for 100ml, $184 for 50ml.  Le Labo at least retains the unique quality, among higher-end brands, of incentivizing the purchase of smaller bottles by offering to refill them at lower costs than the juice + bottle original price (exactly how much lower, I'm not sure) in lieu of buying wholly new bottles as replacements.  Still, all of Le Labo's offerings now fall roughly into the category of needing to love them in order to buy them.\n\r\nTonka 25 is an easy one for me to love, despite it not pushing boundaries in terms of scent profile (it's agreeable, unisex, versatile) or performance (it's good, more than just satisfactory, but not outstanding), but this is a clear winner from the house as its scent goes, as far as I'm concerned, and I'll give serious thought to acquiring a bottle.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

I think there's a bit of jasmine in there - it adds a billowing quality in the heart. The leather is powdery, but has just an edge of roughness, avoiding it being a straight-up feminine frag. In the base, patch, benzoin and labdanum are all apparent and are all lovely and well-blended.\r\nIt's a lovely frag and I wear it often - it's a great all-rounder, wearing as easily in the daytime as the evening and works well anytime except high summer, when it is perhaps just a little too sweet and sits a little too heavily. In terms of style, it's fairly mainstream and has mass-appeal - it gets the odd compliment.\r\nIt's clearly synthetic, but the it's of decent quality and well-blended. Would I pay full-price for it? Hell, no. Nuh-uh. It retails (being from the house of Xerjoff) at stupid prices, but wears like a high-quality designer frag.

Honey makes it even creamier, though, further making the blend feel complete.\n\r\nThe other key players are the fresh bergamot, petitgrain, pink pepper that give a bright and pungent opening with a dry down that incorporates rose, albeit only slightly, along with orange blossom, vanilla, woods, and even the slightest touch of oud, perhaps, though I might simply be inserting that. It\u2019s really not an oud-heavy fragrance on my skin and most of the darkness in it I attribute to the nuances in the various resins in the mix. \n\r\nAmber Absolutely is a boozy, fruity amber, while Suleyman Le Magnifique is a cinnamon amber, to summarize them succinctly, but Forty Thieves is a more animalic-leaning blended amber with the fresh opening and rose dry rendering it somewhat different from the other two. \n\r\nIt\u2019s never particularly easy testing off of a dabber from Luckyscent, the only US boutique that sells the Fort & Manle, but with richer fragrance like this, it\u2019s manageable. It performs on par with the other resinous fragrances, with good longevity and projection, but the main selling point of this fragrance is the quality of the composition in terms of nuance, complexity, and completeness. Forty Thieves retails for $190 for 50ml and like all previous releases, the bottle is ornate and mostly opaque, really among my favorite bottle types as far as art.\n\r\nOverall, I love this one and it\u2019s right in my wheelhouse, category-wise, so it\u2019s on the proverbial list for a bottle.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

			"content": "Oh this is cute. Parfums de Marly decided to make a fresh foug\u00e8re with Percival (2018), and instead of directly copying one or two popular designer examples, they decided to mix a few different styles together. I don't want to like it, because it's just another luxury redressing of a blue collar vibe with over-amped performance, but I actually do. In this instance, we are getting a note pyramid mostly similar to Montblanc Legend (2011), a fragrance known by many in the hobbyist community affectionately as \"expensive Axe\", mixed with slightly more-recent developments found in fragrances like Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue (2016). The base is fattened and rounded out with higher quality aromachems in the usual way Parfums de Marly does, but there isn't anything particularly niche about the execution, and this is yet another example from the house of a scent meant for the rich STEM or medical professionals that have enough interest in perfume to watch the occasional YouTube reviewer rant about a brand like this. In an almost comical way, the matte blue finish of the bottle on this one is very reminiscent of the racing blue I see on some BMW cars, so it's very fitting for the intended market segment. Unlike some past efforts such as Herod (2012) or Layton (2016), Percival also manages to not come across cloying despite obvious base note enhancements. \n\r\nThe opening here in Percival is almost the spitting image of the first ten minutes of Creed Himalaya (2002), with metallic aldehydes (eg: helonial), dry bergamot, and a sweet citrus like mandarin for counter-balance. I'd almost call this a lower-cost alternative to the Creed, since Percival is about $200 cheaper, but even at $300 MSRP you have to really love what is being offered, and because this is such a common idea being represented, the chance of such a love affair is unlikely. From this Himalaya-like opening, we switch into the \"Montblanc phase\", with jasmine, lavender, geranium, coriander, and cinnamon creating a rather round, spicy, clean, and smooth \"shower gel masculine\" vibe. A tiny speck of violet infers some similarity to Creed Green Irish Tweed (1985) as other note, but it is gone is a hurry, as the final \"Versace phase\" of the base comes about. In this final turn, we get a healthy dose of norlimbanol and ambroxan, with some \"generic blue 90's thing\" filling in the gaps, but a larger quantity of musk and evernyl than in the Versace, plus some tonka and fir balsam. Overall, this smells better than Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue, but for three times the price, I don't know if it's better enough to justify the leap. Wear time is over 8 hours and sillage is good but not obnoxious. I'd stick to office or casual use with Percival if I was to buy it. \n\r\nI commend Parfums de Marly for finally being able to make a niche-priced designer dupe that actually smells like more time and attention went into it than the designer it parrots (and not just more/stronger ingredients), but this is still far and away from anything a hobbyist would qualify as niche. Luckily for Parfums de Marly, they're not trying to capture the same market as someone like Serge Lutens or Amouage, so they're not so worried if the oakmoss-huffing and oud-licking segment of the market doesn't get their fix of natural-smelling bases and is able to prattle off the chemicals they smell in a scent like Percival in the same way a kid reads the ingredients on a cereal box. The guy graduating from that aforementioned Montblanc and looking to \"move up to the next level\" after watching a few YouTube videos is the prime candidate for something like Percival, as it is friendly, clean, well-constructed, and smells \"better\" than whatever else such a person may have been using, and without sufficient knowledge in what other options exist, could easily be slipped a bottle by the right salesperson. Once again, I like Percival, but am hard pressed to recommend it to anyone unless a bottle comes across your path at a severe discount due to the glut of alternatives. Thumbs up",

In fact, perhaps Nuit dAzar is the most risky perfume of the house, next to the Muscat Sultan, but for different reasons: the black currant and sap accord is really fragile and \"thin\", very light and yet with that penetrating characteristic of the strong openings of feminine ingredients. The perfume is directed, in the drydown, towards a critical point that some see emerge with impatience, exactly as if it were the opening of a flower, and it is a nocturnal flower, artificial and capricious: under the stars, the fragrance is \" bankrupt \"in a sweet bitterness, as if the vetiver wanted to get rid of the dream of beauty, in a sour and timid -sad- dissonance(nothing herbal nor earthy, however, but more spicy, more careless, not as if the drydown revealed the body of the fragrance, but as if it were from the beginning the stem of a fragile flower, and that to bloom briefly disappear in a sigh of tender agony). This perfume, which perhaps derives its beauty from carelessness and overly daring foolishness on the part of the perfumer, however, it is presented as the rare flower of a dubious oriental fantasy, barely materialized in one possibility: for me this fragrance is a brief vision of a dream, isolated and simple, ephemeral and incredulous.\n\r\nPS: The color of the perfume is blue, no doubt about it, and its environment is night. After smelling it carefully, I do not think this is a great perfume, but, of course, it is beautiful, with all its gourmand strangeness that gives the blackcurrant (creamy) surrounded by the clean incense of sage (my favorite ingredient).The duration and the projection, like all the perfumes of this house, are very scarce.",

It definitely has the Cherry Coke vibe in the opening, but it's not quite on point. The dry down smells more like a fizzy Coca-Cola with the fruitier notes dissipating. A couple of years ago I found a clone fragrance called Estrada, I think.. I have my bottle somewhere. It did a great job copying the top notes of Magnetism, but not so much the dry down. This one does the dry down very well imo. It seems to have solid projection too. Doesn't smell cheap, but it does smell synthetic, but if you know Magnetism, it's quite a synthetic frag. I think this one is pretty good. Dua also makes a clone of Magnetism, but I haven't tried it. Not too keen on buying from Dua or Alexandria, since they're actually pretty expensive for what you get. They could easily both be charging $25 a bottle and still make profit, but they are gouging for sure. However, I did really want a solid Magnetism like smell in my collection again, and nothing has come as close as this has. Projection seems quite good, but longevity I cannot say yet. ",

This similar clean high pitched wood tone is apart of other new Montale perfumes such as Vetiver Patchouli, Leather Patchouli, Bakhoor, Intense Black Aoud, and Fantastic Aoud.

It's an offensive cologne and if you like to be that guy who fills a room with whatever cheap synthetic notes because it has a Versace logo on it then more power to you. I'm just not \"that guy\". Don't get me started with the Ad's for this as well... I'm Not buying what your selling Versace",

			"content": "Eros Flame (2018) seems to be part of a late 2010's \"fire themed\" flanker rollout taking place among designers, coming full-circle from the fire-themed gourmands that started rolling out mid-to-late 2000's. It's almost like we're stuck in this endless loop of aquatic, airy, earthy, and firey synthetic themes that skirt completely over traditional genres like chypres,  foug\u00e8res, and orientals, even if sometimes those categories are used as adjectives to describe things otherwise far more abstract. Maybe I'm just not \"fired up\" for the style Eros Flame represents. I see no real fire in it at all, just another orange-themed clubber that feels like a seventh son of the seventh son of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008). The original Versace Eros (2013) was penned by Aur\u00e9lien Guichard and represented an interesting merger of rich clubber oriental tones and a fresh minty semi-foug\u00e8re accord that was versatile enough to pull double duty as a work and play scent. Eros Flame is penned by Olivier Pescheux, who is literally ONE OF THE GUYS who created Paco Rabanne 1 Million, and feels like the result of him being asked to recreate 1 Million as a Versace fragrance. I can imagine being asked to more or less plagiarize your own work (rather than do it surreptitiously by desire like Pierre Bourdon has done once or twice), it must feel like being typecast, and the results are likely to become less and less endearing each time. Maybe it's time designers like Versace break out of these silly elemental cycles and extreme/sport/intense/nuit/blue nonsense and do something novel? Considering Olivier Pescheux's track record with Diptyque, I know he can do way better than this. \n\r\nEros Flame does indeed open as one might expect a parroting of Paco Rabanne 1 Million by one of its own perfumers to open: with heaps of tart orange and spice. Tangerine, orange, and black pepper all swirl together to offer a more piquant and less sweet take on the theme, but the smooth lemon and bright geranium notes let you know before long that original Eros is still underneath it all, if being held prisoner by the embellishments. non-existent rose my nose doesn't detect is listed in the heart, alongside a healthy ambroxan dose that is the only heat to Eros Flame, with an aromatic dry rosemary joining hay-like tonka also returning to its previous role in the heart, just like the original Eros but a tad more herbal. Eros Flame is surprisingly irritating in its dry down stages compared to the older Eros, ditching much of the sugar and mulled spice for a more-prominent cedar  and vetiver note than the original, likely meant to imply a hearth-like woodsiness but just feeding the \"fire\" of the aromachemical base. The rest of the development in Eros Flame bares no resemblance to the pillar after which it is named, with a bleached synthetic patchouli, and something like a red bell pepper mixed with scratchy norlimbanol called \"pepperwood\" (likely a custom or captive) doing the talking. There's a bit of vanilla here too but it isn't on the same level as the original blue bottle. Eros Flame has weaker sillage despite being spicier and harsher, but maybe that was on purpose, like Versace was doing everyone else in the club around the asshole wearing this a favor by making it harder for him to over-apply. Outside this bit of mercy, Eros Flame is by no means weak. Longevity is about as impressive as the original Eros too, so no need to worry about carrying the bottle around, but this is also nowhere near as versatile either, so I don't suggest wearing it work unless you're planning on making a \"statement\" to coworkers or clients unawares.\n\r\nI went on a long diatribe about the original Eros because it was just so different and dynamic compared to what else was out at the time, and what else Versace themselves had released, being the first really creative masculine perfume from the house since Versace The Dreamer (1996), but Eros Flame just feels like a chore to wear, a chore to smell, and ultimately a chore to write about, so I have much less to say on it. There isn't a bit of originality here, and this is \"phoned-in oriental spice and scratchy synthwoods galore\" like countless other clubbers still trying to be \"the next 1 Million\" a decade later, which is really sad since it's in a pretty cool red version of the Versace Eros bottle crested with a gold cap. The packaging here is more than on point, but the juice inside deflates me faster than Aunt May unwittingly sitting on a whoopie cushion placed by one of the brat nephews on Thanksgiving. Anyone looking for a really different and distinctive youth-friendly juice made for the club but equally at-home in a work or college environment should explore the original Versace Eros, which is probably the best of the breed. Fans of 1 Million that want to fill a wardrobe with smell-alikes might find a bit of redemption here as a slightly drier (but scratchier) take, while most others not as enamored with that ubiquitous and sometimes cloying style will take one sniff of this and go \"oh no, not another one\". This isn't the first time Versace has been guilty of going through the motions (see 2008's Versace Pour Homme), and surely won't be the last, and I guess I should be grateful this idea is presented as a flanker of Eros rather than a new pillar. Thumbs down. ",

I honestly think the blend works so well with the beautiful woody Vanilla sweetness of Eros that comes in the dry-down.

It is thought that Dr. Albersheim was a victim of Naziism, as his Jewish heritage worked against the Aryanization plans of Hitler\u2019s Germany. Albersheim\u2019s niece married Ludwig Scherk, another German perfumer, who also suffered the same fate. \n\r\nThe 1920s were the heyday of the Scherk and Dr. Albersheim firms. Albersheim conquered the market with Germany\u2019s first line of perfume and cosmetics with the same fragrance (\"Khasana\").  The success stories of many Jewish firms came to an end with the Nazi rise to power. Ludwig Scherk was forced to sell his company to the Schering AG for a price substantially below its actual value in 1938. The Dr. Albersheim company was taken over by Dr. Korthaus, a former senior manager at the \"IG Farben\" concern. The change of logo and label on the exhibited products are evidence of the ruin of the Jewish family companies. Their relations emigrated to England, France, and the USA.\n\r\nLaunched in 1922, Pr*a*rie was one of Dr. Albersheim's leading and most popular perfumes.  The Perfume Encyclopedia lists 9 scents by the company, stretching from 1906 to 1936: Khasana (1906); Amber (1920); J Sola Bella (1922); Pr\u2019a\u2019rie (1922); Salugen (1924); Li (1925); Maiglockchen (1925); Peri (1926); Pacific (1936).\n\n",

I really wanted to dislike this as I did Fucking Fabulous (2017) and Lavender Extr\u00eame (2019), but there is just something a bit fun about Lost Cherry (2018) which makes that impossible. Primarily, the scent is more complex than one might suspect and dries down into tobacco (which is always nice), even if performance is extremely underwhelming. Lost Cherry is a gourmand tobacco scent at heart, with a tacky theme the likes of which only Tom Ford has the gall to market at this price point, but if you decide it's for you, I'd grab one while you can if it isn't already discontinued by the time you see this, because it is a low-volume seasonal exclusive.\n\r\nLost Cherry opens with... cherry. I mean come on, what else did you expect me to say? There's a maraschino cherry mixed with a bit of amaretto liqueur thanks to the bitter almond sharing the top. The heart sees some rose and jasmine to make Lost Cherry more \"perfumey\" than just what otherwise might just smell like snow cone flavoring, but it's the base where things heat up. Tonka and tobacco undoubtedly borrowed from Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille (2007) make a show, and pair up nice with some cedar and sandalwood for a proper base, with the tobacco being the core theme past the first hour. Sadly, this is also a skin scent by then, even if it lasts all day otherwise. I also think Lost Cherry is quite unisex for fans of the note, and something this decadent can only be worn in a romantic or cold weather casual setting. If you have the audacity to spend top coin to drizzle yourself in Tom Ford's cherries, at least have the reserve not to show up at work in it, thanks.\n\r\nThere aren't a ton of perfumes with a cherry tobacco accord at their core, and the only other notable one I can recall is Burberry London for Men (2006), which luckily won't cost an arm and a leg, even if it is less sweet and a good amount spicier. The niche realms house some pretty strange things, especially in the frivolous-to-the-max realm of luxury lines which serve little other purpose but to be status-inferring symbols of indulgence, so I guess there really isn't much more indulgent out there than wanting to smell like a cherry cordial enjoyed with a smoking pipe. Whatever floats your boat, you had better be willing to pay for it, and due to the limited nature of these seasonal Private Collection releases, you'd better cherish that cherry while you have it. As for me, I give this silly overpriced fling a neutral for giving me a laugh, but I can't take it seriously.",

			"content": "I am obsessed with this fragrance. I received it for Christmas and have already purchased a backup for myself, and if it\u2019s confirmed that this is in fact a limited edition I\u2019ll be saving up to purchase a few more... I\u2019ve honestly never smelled anything like this that moved me (or the money in my wallet) so strongly. \n\r\nThe scent is divinely delicious on me. Sweet cherry syrup that lasts for hours before the woody tonka drydown. I get a hint of almonds but they\u2019re toasted and glazed in the cherry sauce, which I would equate more to a sticky syrup than a boozy liquor, but I don\u2019t drink so maybe I\u2019m just ignorant to how that would smell. Regardless this juice is intoxicating and the entire time it\u2019s on my skin I\u2019m in love with how I smell.\n\r\nThe sillage is actually quite impressive but Tom Ford fragrances are always way ahead of the game in performance versus other designer fragrance lines for me. This is no exception and I\u2019m actually shocked to hear that so many people had issues with this scent not lasting long enough or projecting, I\u2019d say this scent almost knocks me out at times it\u2019s just as strong as some of his other scents (I must stress again, on my skin). I never spray this on clothes, only on my skin, so I\u2019m not sure if that would improve anything, because I don\u2019t need to. There\u2019s nothing about this fragrance I would change, except the price. \n\r\nI highly recommend testing for yourself but I wouldn\u2019t suggest a blind buy even if you\u2019re obsessed with Tom Ford fragrances like me because it\u2019s an awful lot of money to be out of if you\u2019re expectations aren\u2019t met. Mine were exceeded and considering all the negative buzz this scent generated, I was pleasantly surprised. ",

			"content": "The release of Tom Ford Lost Cherry was almost as well-publicized, and seemingly highly anticipated, as that of Fucking Fabulous in late 2017.  In the case of Lost Cherry, the \"limited edition\" label used in FF was no longer a new feature, and since FF eventually became a mainstay, there was little reason to believe it, but lo and behold, Lost Cherry is only available in 50ml bottles (at the same price of FF, OWI, TOI, and NPF) at $320 for 50ml.\n\r\nThe scent, though, is quite great, and frankly it's at least intuitive in that cherry liqueur is a central note.  When combined with tonka and almond, it takes on a sharp, boozy feel, and with peru balsm, rose, and woods, it's creamy and comforting in the dry down.  It's really mostly gourmand without being utterly, completely gourmand.\n\r\nAlmond and tonka are fun additives, especially in concert with one another, like they were in FF.  Almost natural bedfollows, their sweet-yet-creamy-but-sort-of-powdery tartness makes for a fun counterpoint to the cherry liqueur, held by the glue of the balsam and woods, and ever so slightly hint of rose, barely detectable.\n\r\nIt's important to note that Lost Cherry's cherry is relatively short-lived, the cherry being front-and-center for only an hour or two and being wholly in the background after 6 hours.  The fragrance itself lasts somewhat more, not a beast by any means but not as horrible on my skin as some seem to purport it on theirs.\n\r\nPerformance seems to be the main gripe of the fragrance, particularly considering its high pricing, on the higher tier of Tom Ford Private Blend, and it being limited to only 50ml bottle as opposed to flacons that would allow for splits, or even 100ml bottles also, which would be better priced by volume than the 50ml bottles.\n\r\nConsidering performance and pricing issues, the Dua Fragrances alternative of Popped Cherry is particularly appealing in terms of slightly better performance, greater use of cherry, and lower cost, of course, at $65 for 30ml, always discounted further.  I find that both Popped Cherry and Lost Cherry have interesting nuances, the former more cherry-intensive and the latter more generally gourmand, particularly in the dry down.\n\r\nI find Lost Cherry to be a great release, as much as the gimmick of the limited edition, particularly without the availability of flacons (at least for now...a new trick), does start to get bit old, and will undoubtedly test many TF fans, especially with other cherry fragrances out there like Dua's as well as another fresh/sweet/tart realistic cherry fragrance, Hilde Soliani Una Tira L'Altra, which is available on Luckyscent for only $160 for 100ml.\n\r\nStill, I credit the release for drumming up some interest in cherry as a particular note and gourmands as a general category of fragrances. Presumably more clones that Dua's will follow.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

One of the most realistic notes I've ever smelled in a fragrance, it literally smells like you just opened a jar of high end luxardo cherries.

I don't love fragrances that are loud and screamy with projection, and this is a fragrance that leaves a decent sillage trail and can be discovered if someone is close enough. I was really surprised to love this one so much, but on scent alone this has immediately become one of my favorites, and will be a beautiful cold weather/holiday staple of mine. ",

			"content": "Am I going insane or am I writing the same review twice for two different fragrances here? Amouroud is a premium niche line from The Perfumer's Workshop that focuses on oud-based creations as the name suggests, but this is zero for two on the oud-perfume-smelling-like-oud front from a brand that is self-identifying as one for lovers of the note. Going back to my review for Amouroud Oud After Dark (2016), I made note of a perfume that was really structured around the interplay between saffron, synthetic wood, ambroxan, and some novel fruity notes, coming across like an alternative to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 (2015), and again I make the same observation here with Amouroud Oud du Jour (2016). I find that Oud du Jour comes across a bit drier and less-risky than Oud After Dark, plus a bit less of a direct homage to MFK br 540 in the base, which leads me to believe that they were likely two propositions on the same brief by the same perfumer and Amouroud decided to keep both. The name also implies day/night tandem use of both \"oud\" fragrances, but if I had to choose only one, Oud du Jour edges out Oud After Dark only slightly for being the more unique and enjoyable of the two. Still, it is a bit hard to overlook the glaring false advertising present in a house with \"oud\" in their name releasing \"oud\" fragrances that do not even remotely resemble what they claim to be, not even in the slightest.\n\r\nAmouroud Oud du Jour opens with a similar saffron and pink pepper blast, with a \"wild raspberry\" note that feel more tart than the osmnanthus of Oud After Dark, being similar to the blackcurrant in Mancera Cedrat Boise (2011). The scent then moves into a familiar base of plum, synthetic wood stylings, and some dry florals like muguet. Supposedly there is olibanum here, but the only \"incense\" I get is the norlimbanol kind, although it is very slight and not on the scratchy side like with modern designers, showing the perfumer here has a deft hand with synthetic notes. The base is likewise ambroxan but without the tonka sweetness found in Oud After Dark, taking the plum note down into the base of the scent and pairing up with a patchouli isolate for a bit of a \"fruitchouli\" vibe late in the wear. Gaiac wood notes are claimed to be present, but it is the same Akigalawood \"generic woody mossiness\" that Tom Ford favors in his Private Blend bases. Enjoyable, but not an oud scent by any stretch of the imagination, the initial sting of being taken for a fool with Oud After Dark is less painful here in Oud du Jour, since at least Oud du Jour is a woody oriental scent when the chips fall, and gets barely inside the wheelhouse of a synthetic oud (unlike Oud After Dark) for that reason, even if it doesn't smell like one. Wear is average all around, so no need to detail that out for you, but the smell of Oud du Jour is more unisex than Oud After Dark, and better for casual or formal use because it is less sweet. I feel this is still a cold weather fragrance like its sibling as well. \n\r\nWho Oud du Jour will appeal to is anyone's guess, as it doesn't try to ape a more-popular and more-expensive niche competitor like Oud After Dark, which at least in so doing gave it reason to exist for thrifty niche seekers in spite of itself. Casual oud fans with even basic knowledge of more medicinal designer synthetic ouds, let alone those who love the more-natual and animalic stuff, will still have a hard time accepting the farce that the brand is shaping up to be, which is sad because the non-oud entries in Amouroud's catalog are really freakin' nice. Just who is going to shop a brand pretending it specializes in ouds for their non-oud lines? Nobody, that's who. If you are a lover of odd and well-done creations, you may very well enjoy Oud du Jour, and fans of Le Labo who are used to knowing what is in the bottle doesn't match what's on the label may also be more lenient with Amouroud, but the brand is batting 1000 in the niche exploitation department for everyone with 2 cents to rub together. The Perfumer's Workshop otherwise has a good reputation for delivering quality pound for pound, so maybe you can overlook this glaring ruse when sampling these \"ouds\", but I certainly can't, although I can't bring myself to dislike this perfume either. Like I said before, at least Byredo interpretations can be recognized as such. Spiced plum and woods over patchouli and \"ambergris\" sounds good to me, just don't try to tell me it's oud or we're going to have some problems.  Neutral",

			"content": "Amouroud is a strange newcomer to the niche scene, representing a full-circle for The Perfumer's Workshop, who were arguably OG hipster niche before the term was prevalent due to their original business model of custom blending fragrances from components right at the counter. The brand quickly moved into ready-made bottles of pre-mixed popular accords, which is how Tea Rose (1972) was born, then gradually moved down market like so many brands did in the 1980's when volume became preferrable to margin as perfume use becamore more ubiquitous. Naturally, The Perfumer's Workshop also branched out into owning licenses for designer-branded perfumes too, and has been a shadow player for years on that front, so it makes sense to use a new name like \"Amouroud\" to re-enter the niche market they partially helped create way back when, since the name of \"The Perfumer's Workshop\" doesn't have the luxury zing today's niche buyers crave. You might be wondering if a name like \"Amouroud\" means a love of \"oud\" (a.k.a. macerated agarwood) and yes, it does, but in this regard the house is a sham because they neither use real oud nor even attempt to make their oud compositions smell like it. However, the other lines Amouroud has do offer a lot of quality for their niche price tag, since The Perfumer's Workshop has always offered value since the beginning, but some compositions like Dark Orchid (2016) sit a bit too close to their inspirations for comfort. To be blunt, Dark Orchid is a clone of Tom Ford Black Orchid (2016), almost a decade to the day since Tom Ford launched his house with the erstwhile oriental gourmand chypre hybrid, but seeks to be a true unisex composition in tone rather than one which is inadvertently unisex through co-opting by men.\n\r\nBlack Orchid isn't exactly niche, but the price tag of even the signature lines from Tom Ford makes it one of the rare designers that dwells in the niche space, so I can see why Amouroud would target it and make a riff based on it. The opening of Amouroud Dark Orchid is very much like the aforementioned Tom Ford, but less sweet, less bright, and made greener with the addition of fig leaf. Herein the bergamot/mandarin/gardenia opening of Black Orchid loses the jasmine hedione in exchange for the fig leaf, and the heart of lotus/orchid/spice (all basically made up notes) is stripped of any fruity sweetness too. A dry ylang-ylang replaces what is missing from this heart, and the experience continues on as a more-serious and less-sensual Black Orchid, although Amouroud's clone does get some real personality of its own late in the wear. The patchouli and sandalwood base of Black Orchid are built up with olibanum and amber, which goes entirely opposite to the way the tonka and chocolate notes round out the experience. Instead, Amouroud Dark Orchid is  gothic in a sombre Guillermo del Toro way rather than a kitschy Tim Burton way, and slightly more formal to boot. Wear time is outstanding and sillage is good. Projection here is pretty impresesive too, and because Dark Orchid is not very sweet, it doesn't feel as cloying in the heat. I'd say office use may be a bit much, but anyone can wear Dark Orchid in the evening year-round, even in situations where a \"come hither\" trail is not wanted. For me, Dark Orchid just screams \"formal dinner with the in-laws\", so take that as you may.\n\r\nTom Ford Black Orchid is a very iconic perfume, and there haven't been many if any noteworthy attempts to emulate it outside the fly-by-night Middle Eastern clone houses or operations like Alexandria, Dua, and so forth. Definitely no other designers have really tried to touch Black Orchid, or else whatever you want to call its style would be a genre of its own by now, and I would not so easily be able to label this scent a clone. To be honest, I usually avoid using the term \"clone\" because it is a mark of condemnation from the YouTuber-worshipping \"frag bro\" subset of the fragrance enthusiast community, and wielded improperly, can call the failure of a fragrance. In this case, the term \"clone\" just fits too perfectly, and Amouroud Dark Orchid is a damn good one at that, taking something so notoriously decadent as the brand-launching scent from Tom Ford and cleaning it up with a bit of tweaking to be more oriental and less gourmand. People who don't enjoy fig may not really dig Dark Orchid, and people who really don't like the core of Black Orchid may not like it either, but if sweetness and cloying sillage were your biggest complaints, or you want to steer closer to true unisex accords rather than bounce around the spectrum, Amouroud Dark Orchid may be the alternative for you. I have to dock some points for originality because a house that makes oud fragrances that aren't really oud fragrances has an uphill battle on principle alone, but the quality and performance are undeniable even at the prices they charge, and everyone -but- those poor oud takes has been top-notch from the house. Thumbs up. ",

			"content": "The house of Amouroud is the new niche arm of The Perfumer's Workshop, the once niche-before-niche-was-a-thing upstart perfume brand-turned-conglomerate on the success of their early hits, who has for years silently bought up licenses for designers and drugstore brands alike to act in a similar manner to Bogart Group or Puig. The irony of all ironies here is that the house, which is an obvious portmanteau of the Italian word for \"love\" and the word \"oud\", doesn't actually use any real oud in their scents. I know that even at the $150-$200 price point, real aoud is still not to be expected because actual macerations of the stuff can cost hundreds for just a few drops, hence the extreme expense of artisanal perfumes which use it, but one would think that Amouroud would at least give the old \"college try\" at making a reasonably-convincing synthetic compound. Well, the answer to that is decidedly \"no\", because I find myself singing \"Is this oud that I'm feeling\" in the voice of Whitesnake's David Coverdale as I wear the stuff on skin. What makes the smell of Oud After Dark by Amouroud (2016) so much worse is that the base doesn't even resemble the medicinal synthetic oud notes we're used to in designers. Hell, the cheapo One Man Show Oud Edition by Jacques Bogart (2014) does a better job of a reasonable oud accord than many of the Tom Ford Private Blends, and even has a bit of an animalic kick to boot. Instead of that, Oud After Dark goes in a similar direction to later (and much more expensive) Initio Oud for Greatness (2018), but just simply forgets to have an oud accord at all. \n\r\nWhat is here in Oud After Dark is worth sniffing however, as you get an opening of saffron, pepper, and some rather genderbend fruity floral notes like osmanthus and orchid. The middle lists an oud note but in reality this is a plum and shoe leather accord augmented with a synthetic wood type which I can't fully peg but resembles Tom Ford's beloved Akigalawood. You get a bit of black shoe polish, plum, and wood mixing with the fruity spicy opening, balancing between dry and sweet, before the real star players show up for the majority of the time on skin. There is Turkish rose listed too but I don't detect any noticeable rose, so if it's there, it must be just a pin drop. There is tonka, plus an ambroxan note which mixes with the pepper, spice, and wood mentioned above to form a feel similar to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 (2015), to which this scent most resembles. Oud for Greatness also gets some comparison to Br 540 because of the saffron and synthetic elements in it too, but it still has an oud note in it, however designer-like of an oud note that may be. Here in Oud After Dark, there is none of that, just the saffron, the leather, the plum, some smooth synthetic woods, tossed with a softening pinch of vanilla and musk near the end. Amouroud mentioned tobacco in their official note breakdown, but that's just the tonka. Maybe the oud comes after dark like the name implies? I waited until sundown for this one before writing my review, and still no oud. Wear time is over 8 hours and performance for both sillage and projection is above average, and overall vibe here suggests cool weather evening wear to me. I guess this can read as romantic from the sweetness, spice and musk, but if I smelled it on someone, I might mistake it for a business perfume due to the dry woods note that leaps out now and then.\n\r\nIs this nice? Yeah, sure it is. I particularly enjoy the plum and the saffron paired with the really smooth woods in the base, although I can do without the apricot-like osmanthus opening note. In the end, this will appeal to fans of Br 540 more than fans of oud fragrances, and people who want something adjacent to the costly Oud for Greatness. Is this truly unisex like the label claims? Maybe, but most women with conventional (also read: mainstream) tastes will not like the scent beyond the opening 30 minutes, unless they're into woody tonka perfumes. Trying to make an oud-like accord with zero oud or even oud replacer notes is something that seems to be en vogue with some niche houses, and Byredo attempted a similar thing to Amouroud, with better results, but I just can't get over the fact that the house doing this is called Amouroud in the first place. I reviewed one of Amouroud's non-oud compositions first (from the white line) and found it really good, so I went into this expecting a well-done synthetic oud at an entry-level niche price point a la Diptyque or Perris Monte Carlo, especially because The Perfumer's Workshop performs natural-smelling miracles at the lower-end of their wares. I wouldn't buy this literal bamboozle in a bottle, but I admit it does smell well-composed for what it is. You may have a different opinion depending on how you feel about being baited and switched with perfume nomenclature, which if you're a fan of Le Labo and their practices, may be something you're already used to by now.

Despite its name, Vetiver Nocturne is not an inky Black Vetiver, like Encre Noir or even a pure earthy Vetiver bomb, like Frederic Malle\u2019s Vetiver Extraordinare.  \n\r\nInstead, Bortnikoff uses a base of oakmoss and sandalwood(with some oud and ambergris) to amp up the creamy, minty facets of Ruh Khus(a pure Indian Vetiver) and a great burst of Jasmine and Champaca absolute to balance some sweetness against the earthen aspects of the grass. \n\r\nAt times the whole thing skews fruity-indolic, like very ripe bananas, papayas or mangoes. And at other times the various contrasts of fresh, floral, deep earthen, sweet fruit pushes it into Bortnikoff\u2019s somewhat familiar territory of bubble gum fit for a king. \n\r\nThis may sound off-putting but the whole thing is unexpectedly beautiful and wears like an exotic fougere from a undiscovered land.

It is still camp fire and incense but sweeter and less burnt plastic. Hours later it's bright and shinning but the dangerous projection of the opening really calms down. It is the dry down that I love and which goes on and on... luckily. HYDE lingers on clothes for days, on the skin ... next day during shower I get strong marvelous wafts of it as warm water hits the skin.

It is a fine jasmine, with a green undertone and quite elegant.  A sideline of peonies, muguet and a very light tuberose - no raisinous or waxy components here - cements the floral power in the heart notes.  \n\r\nThere is a sweetness and creaminess to it that adds an agreeable smoothness to this blend. \n\r\nThe base changes character nigh completely, and the final phase is a woodsy affair intermingled with white musks. \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, very good projection and six hours of longevity on my skin.   \n\r\nThis scent for cooler spring days is executed very well, with good-quality ingredients in the first part of its development.

Ouch, that\u2019s being mean I guess, but the price on this makes me feel kind of mean. I have to wade through a lot of effusive new-chypreness with it. Which isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for. To bypass my prejudice, I asked myself if I would buy it if it were reasonably priced. Even then, I\u2019m not sure I would.\r\nI\u2019m a chypre person and by that I mean old-style chypre, and by that I mean oakmoss. I miss it so much. It does away with the fluff you see here and in so many \u2018new chypres\u2019. It\u2019s loss is incalculable and the reason I almost gave up fragrances. The void it left hasn\u2019t really been filled yet, but I have hopes its loss will spur some new intelligent, sensual basenotes to fill its place, perhaps the new \u2018cleaned-up\u2019 oakmoss. For me oakmoss was just so intelligent and edgy and satisfied so many dark needs. It has a sensuality musk, wood and the new synthetic animalics don\u2019t possess. There were few more intelligent notes. \r\nSo that\u2019s one thing lacking in this grand, opulent chypre - intelligence. I feel that lack wearing it, as I do light inconsequential fragrances. This isn\u2019t a young-versus-old determination. Chypre Extraordinaire has some delicious notes, some sweet memory-filled resonances, but little discretion and little edge. \r\nOn the plus side, its showy character would suit a large effusive personality. It has good quality materials - they feel authentic. It has only moderate aldehydes, so it isn\u2019t a rude fragrance, just large, bordering on bombastic. Its drydown is long-lasting, a plus during a time of disappearing drydowns. So I can\u2019t give it a thumbs-down - it has several nice qualities, and is delicious. But its worst quality is its price and that it reminds me of what I miss.",

			"content": "Wood Pour Homme by DSquared2 (2018) is a reworking of the original He Wood (2007) with perfumer Daphney Bugey brought back alongside mainstream hired gun Alberto Morillas, and the results are very disappointing. To say the least, He Wood was not really missed when the entire Dsquared2 line was scrapped and the perfume house rebooted, but it wasn't without its fans. The basic fruity soft accords over Iso E Super fake woods base was a real let down after grasping the solid wood framed original bottle, and this newest iteration sports a huge maple leaf as if Wood pour Homme was the unofficial men's fragrance of Canada, while delivering a slightly more-rounded experience that ends just as sadly. Overall if feels like Daphney Bugey ran through some notes from the most popular men's entries in the mostly-failed former catalog of Dsquared2, and remixed them with a little bit of help from the AI-assisted assembly line cyborg perfuming technowizard Morillas. A bit of the ambery muskiness of Dsquared2 Wild (2014) is spliced into the DNA of He Wood, and the whole thing is lifted onto an ambrox framework. The whole Wood pour Homme experience is a mix tape of meh, a return of the beige apologetic feel of the 90's in 2010's trappings. Asleep yet? You should be.\n\r\nThe opening is the best part, with bergamot, lemon, ginger, and mandarin orange leading with a sweet spicy charge. After this ends, we're moved into cardamom, violet, vetiver, and some nondescript dusty white florals making this feel like a flunked Calvin Klein seasonal flanker. It's a bit interesting, but not satisfying like the top, but since most modern designer things not made by the big players live and die by the top notes at the point of sale due to budgetary strangling, I can't really say I didn't see this coming. The soft semi-powdery amber comes next, with cashmeran \"white woods\", laundry musk, Iso E Super, and the obvious ambrox warmth coming in on skin. The finish leaves us with a pillowy soft, richer, more urbane take on the original He Wood, which some people looking for a pleasantly inoffensive but decently-projecting office fragrance might desire, but anyone expecting the fragrance to deliver upon the promise made by the bucolic packaging will find lacking. Wear time is about 6 hours, so you'll need to reapply in a work day, and this seems generalist enough for any time of year save the dead of summer. Prices are obviously on designer levels but I'm sure this will flush out to discounters within a short time because it really lacks any sense of style. \n\r\nThe market for Wood pour Homme exists, and is mainly the tech-savvy but fashion-daft white collar STEM dude who wants to be \"one of the guys\" with his AWD blue Subaru equipped with roof rack and REI sticker, but reveals his inner techbro by stopping to play Pokemon Go while unkempt in sandals and socks on the way to Whole Foods for that kombucha he likes. He doesn't really care about fragrance let alone deodorant but the bottle looked rugged, manly, and it smelled \"nice enough\", plus he wanted to \"up his game\" a little ever since Wendy from Marketing started smiling at him on the way back from Monday meetings. If this poor desperate cash-flush but clueless sort of sod fits the description of someone you know, buy them a bottle of Wood pour Homme so they can have \"some nice cologne\", but anyone else with even a small modicum of desire to smell like they care about the way they smell would do much better to explore other options at the same counter where this is displayed. Wood pour Homme is not only a huge misnomer, but one of the most boring things I have sampled released in the 2010's. Sample and see for yourself. Thumbs down.",

The smell of this combination felt like a perfume composed in a La-Z-Boy recliner at Dominique Ropion's home, as if he was surfing Netflix while scribbling notes on how to make the fastest buck for the house who commissioned him. The end result to me comes across like the embodiment of every adulteration designer perfume has embraced since the beginning of the 1990's; every sin committed, every cheap cop-out, every stylistic boor, every pastiche cliche of consumerist culture and shopping mall blah since the rise of the aquatic and fresh foug\u00e8re compounded into one Antichrist of a masculine fragrance, signalling Armageddon on the perfume counters of department stores everywhere. Y by Yves Saint Laurent was so trashy and basic that it should have been a guest on Jerry Springer. We're talking not one, but multiple generations of cost-cutting BS crammed into one anathema de toilette for men. Granted, it's perfectly dialed-in for the brainless \"my girlfriend likes it\" CISHET upper middle-class American code monkey suburbanite you'll likely find these days in California, Washington, Northern Virginia, and New York, since they have to smell respectable while waiting in line for their Tesla Model 3 reservation to be completed, while their vapid significant others take duckface selfies on Instagram and chat about the latest Real Housewives episodes, but I digress. Y Eau de Parfum is the first real competition the Bleu de Chanel dynasty has had since 2010, and this is in light of all the BdC flankers as well, since all the other \"me too\" compositions from other houses in the wake of the watershed Chanel masculine have been too contrived, boring, or different in tone to be real contenders. \n\r\nThe things that turn around the cultural and olfactory trainwreck that is Y by Yves Saint Laurent and into something palatable are improvements in tone and texture. Most of the note pyramid is otherwise left alone, but the few key things that made the original so irritating are removed, to be replaced by notes which help the rest of the perfume make more sense, or that's how I see it anyway. Y Eau de Parfum doesn't try to be a crappy new-age aquatic-ish candied amber fresh foug\u00e8re \"everyone please like me\" all-in-one generational stopgap focus group hot mess like Y by Yves Saint Laurent. Instead, this draws a line in the sand and leans towards nightclub-friendly \"fresh oriental\" tones, which opens up a whole new can of worms since a lot of people hate clubber scents, but I'd much rather smell Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008), Versace Eros (2013), or Azzaro Wanted by Night (2018) over the midlife crisis jus that is Y by Yves Saint Laurent. At least with Y Eau de Parfum, Dominique Ropion focuses the camera lens on one specific purpose, trading out the phoney aldehydes in the bergamot ginger top for apple, which makes the scent instantly more comoforable and inviting for nightlife. The middle sees the sage and geranium of the original rounded out by juniper instead of the shrill violet leaf of the original. The overall effect by the midpoint of the wear is a modern sweetness which is still an acquired taste, but one that doesn't require selling your soul like the original release. By the base, the blue-hued sweetness of Y Eau de Parfum pulls away from any comparisons to the heavy-handed Eros or Wanted by Night since it takes a dialed-down play from the Bleu de Chanel (2010) playbook, which is perhaps the only use of \"amberwoods\" that has ever truly been accepted by hobbyists, made all the more amusing because it is the first significant use of the accord anyway. If Ropion was emulating the work of Jacques Polge, he did a good job, as cedar, cashmeran, ambroxan, and olibdanum mix with more-traditional foug\u00e8re elements like tonka, vetiver, and a pinch of oakmoss. Y Eau de Parfum still may not redeem itself in the eyes of niche or vintage zealots, but it's the new pillar release that Y by Yves Saint Laurent should have been, and stands strong as a unique entry in a popular style, rather than previous Frankenstein's monster of aromachemicals encompassing three decades of boring to the point of offensiveness. Wear time will vary but this is over the 10 hour mark and is softer in sillage than the original EdT as well. \n\r\nLike with Sauvage Eau de Parfum (2018), Y Eau de Parfum atones for the sins of its opportunistic EdT predecessor, while retaining a familiar personality for fans who enjoyed it, but refined into something that has more artistic merit and validity in the greater scheme of perfume history. Fans of Creed or Xerjoff will still hate this, and fans of long-dead overpriced vintage Patou or Gucci masculines will still call this a lapdog of Satan in a bottle, but Y Eau de Parfum at least takes the \"amberwoods powerhouse\" trope of the 2010's in a more aromatic and pleasant direction. I don't mind aromachemicals if they're blended skillfully into a fragrance, but I don't like it when they assault my nose with impunity and come across like somebody is trying to cast the widest net to reel in the largest haul of suckers. I have to work with those people, and they fog up the bathrooms and elevators enough as it is with over-application, so they can at least wear something that feels friendly and interesting to the nose. People who weren't convinced with Y by Yves Saint Laurent but who dig modern designer styles should give this a sniff, but people who have long since unplugged from the designer realms probably won't find enough here to warrant a revisit, so I'm only pitching this to people who actually like where perfume in this segment has headed over the last 15 years. For anyone falling outside of that circle, you'll at least find Y Eau de Parfum more tolerable than it's precursor EdT, but still not your cup of tea. As for me, it might be a long while before it ends up in the collection, and if it does by the time you read my review, consider me bored enough to have pulled the trigger on it, since buying Y Eau de Parfum is like adding sour cream to a standard Taco Bell taco in a late night food run: it is a significant upgrade, but only satisfies in lieu of better options. For me personally, Y Eau de Parfum is like drinking RC Cola when tired of Pepsi or Coke, which is about where it sits on the priority of usage too, and is barely above board enough for a thumbs up. Test before diving in, especially if you're on the fence about amberwoods freshies, but at least go forward knowing that this actually has some considerable chops, unlike the original Y by Yves Saint Laurent, which I still hate. Again, small tweaks to a formula can make all the difference between good and bad in perfumery. ",

Soon the tobacco and violet leaf emerged providing a bright spicy accord fused with some lushes green feel to it. The tobacco resembles the one of Creed Tabarome Millesime. It\u2019s quite potent and becomes a bit polarizing after a while. The tobacco does taper a little but sticks around. The base is met by vetiver which is of the drier and darker kind. A little bit of ambergris can be detected as well, something common in many Creeds. The drydown I felt was a wrestle between the tobacco and vetiver notes. This one has long lasting longevity. \n\r\nOverall, this one does not appeal to me much. This one reminds of Tabarome Millesime, which is a Creed that I do not enjoy, and this is one that I can\u2019t wear. It also felt a bit more modern compared to the others. Most importantly the tobacco combined with the violet leaf, (and moss?) is something I can\u2019t get passed. I enjoy vetiver scents but the other notes just make this impossible to enjoy. The quality is definitely there and this one does stand out but just not for me. ",

After this, the citrus fades away & the vetiver takes a smokier turn, before being joined by tobacco & a pronounced ambergris note. I don't get any florals here, but two hours into the drydown the smoke & salty ambergris combine to make things more enjoyable.

			"content": "Le Canotier opens with a slightly bracing, bitter-green orange bergamot and violet leaf tandem before transitioning to its heart.  As the composition enters its early heart, the sharp-green violet leaf recedes but remains, now joining dulled orange in support of an emerging lemon-like woody vetiver that takes the fore.  During the late dry-down the composition development stays relatively linear as the vetiver remains the star, only softening slightly as time passes as the violet leaf vacates to reveal an underlying mild, natural smelling tobacco leaf in support through the finish.  Projection is outstanding, as is longevity at well over 15 hours on skin.\n\r\nLe Canotier is somewhat of a departure from most of the Rogue offerings by talented perfumer Manuel Cross.  While most of the line focuses on compositions of the past, with many the *distant* past... Le Canotier feels quite modern in style and structure by comparison.  I can see how one going into smelling the composition expecting a more classical structure based on the others in the line could walk away surprised and disappointed by the perfume, but this writer finds the sharp, lemony vetiver-centric modern perfume to be quite compelling and intoxicating regardless.  The perfumer's deft use of the supporting blonde tobacco to take a bit of the edge off the vetiver as time passes is a particularly interesting and wholly successful choice, with the combination working well when sniffed up close on skin, but even more effective in the sillage.  The bottom line is the $110 per 60ml bottle Le Canotier may be a stark departure for perfumer Cross, but in no way an unwelcome one, earning an \"excellent\" to \"outstanding\" 4 to 4.5 stars out of 5 rating, and an easy recommendation.

The heart phase of this one does remind me of Estee Lauder's Private Collection Tuberose Gardenia, dominated as it is by a very similar gardenia note. In fact, Champs Lunaires smells how PCTG would if it had been left out in bright sunlight for a few weeks. PCTG is rounder, smoother, more modern somehow, whereas CL has this musty, \"turned\" aspect that gives it more of a vintage feel.

As the composition enters its early heart the amber-like relatively sweet labdanum and now deepening pipe tobacco accord remain now as co-stars, as the the labdanum adds a leather-like facet to the mix along with supporting gentle warm saffron spice and subtle hints of floral jasmine.  During the late dry-down, the composition remains linear as it eschews some of its early sweetness and the jasmine floral, as a mildly sweet vanilla and soft woody sandalwood tandem in the base gradually emerges and takes the fore, coupling with remnants of the labdanum and pipe tobacco remaining from the heart now in a supporting role through the finish.  Projection is very good and longevity excellent at over 12 hours on skin.\n\r\nIt took me a bit of time to completely come around to Derviche.  The early amber-like sweetness comes off a tad synthetic smelling and a touch too sweet for this writer's aversion to sweet compositions.  That said, the ambery labdanum calms down as time passes as the pleasant smelling pipe-like tobacco accord takes hold.

While I doubt Derviche will go down as perfumer Cross' best work, when viewed as a relatively straightforward ambery sweet pipe tobacco and vanilla composition, it is a successful one that is hard to dislike and much easier to fall in love with, as I did. The bottom line is the $150 per 100ml bottle Derviche may not show off Mr. Cross' immense talent like the much more complex Chypre-Siam does, but for what it is, the composition is an addictive and successful relatively sweet pipe tobacco focused \"excellent\" 4 stars out of 5 rated perfume that is recommended in particular to lovers of compositions like Tobacco Vanille, but want a bit more complexity.

The amber accord is not as dark and resinous as I was expecting it to be but it\u2019s not super sweet either. Floral jasmine is met with a sugary amber vaniila accord at the base. In addition, I was able to detect woods and musk in the base. The drydown makes me think of Hermessence Ambre Narguile but it\u2019s not exactly the same. A very nice scent overall. \n\r\nLongevity and silage were good although not as bold as Mousse Illuminee or Le Canotier. I think this is perfect for the individuals who enjoy both amber and jasmine.

			"content": "This was a difficult wear for me. Mousse Illuminee projects like a nuclear winter. It is so potent that I had a metallic taste in my mouth while wearing it. I disagree that this is anything like vintage Polo green which I've worn for 36 years. Polo is much more a blend of notes and much less sharp. I can smell the pine, the oakmoss, the tobacco and the leather as Polo develops whereas MI burned through me like a torch from the moment of application. The overall vibe of Mousse Illuminee reminds me much more of Esencia by Loewe but turned up from about 8 for Esencia to 100 for Mousse Illuminee. There is a sharpness here that was painful to my senses so I know that I'm going to have to go extremely light on the sprays next time I wear it, or perhaps I should say, \"spray\" because I don't think there's any need for me to wear more than one spray the next time around. I believe it's the oakmoss that is so potent and it almost feels like it's been mixed with some juniper berry (although not listed in the notes), for good measure to increase the sharpness. The soapy aspect is also big and loud and projects throughout the wear as well. I respect the use of the natural materials and need to adjust my normal usage so I don't overdose my senses next time I apply. Neutral for now until I figure out how to wear this one without hurting myself. LOL...",

I get a whole succession of other notes, though: wormwood, mint, leather, & a suggestion of pine without it smelling like a pine tree. There's a bitterness at this stage, but it's never harsh or unpleasant. After two hours, warm, peppery woods & a gorgeously smoky incense appear, followed by an earthy, loamy note, \"like a forest floor\" as others have described it. There's something akin to vetiver, & then tobacco. Seven hours in, the base is sweet tobacco smoke, woods, a clean, powdery musk & something fruity. The projection is powerful for the first couple of hours, & it's still humming along nicely after fourteen hours.\r\nThis doesn't actually smell like moss to me, & it definitely doesn't smell like weed. I've never smelled Polo Green so cannot make the comparison that others have, but there are echoes here of Memoir Man, perhaps because of the combination of wormwood & incense. Sheik Yerbouti's review describes the feeling of this one very well. It's not my usual style & I don't know when I'd ever wear it, but I find it completely compelling. It's beautifully constructed, complex, natural smelling & has great performance to boot. It's been a while since I smelled a perfume with so many notes, put together so skilfully that each one shone out without mixing themselves into a muddy mess. In short, it's a stunning example of the perfumer's art.",

There is a spiciness in the dry down, which speaks of clove or carnation, but which is not mentioned in the list of notes provided.\n\r\nAlthough everything is present for a powerhouse statement, the whole comes across as quite subdued, but solidly present, something to be enjoyed close up rather than from across a room. I am most impressed by the blending of these notes of \u201cTree moss, Frankincense, Artemesia, Laurel, Cedar, White flowers, White Musk\u201d and although the floral-musk combination tends to fade to the background, the sweetness, mingled with the moss and artemisia, continues to hold forth well into the dry down.\n\r\nI would classify this as solidly masculine, not at all feminine.

Full disclosure, if you don't like green, dirty, earthy, and old school fragrances, you may not like this.\n\r\nMousse Illuminee opens up with a strange accord I couldn't quite interpret, until several wearings, and a mention from another BN'er.

Grapes accompanied by an inky green vibe, similar to the inky opening in Dsquared He Wood, kinda smells like sniffing a Sharpie pen.\n\r\nAs it dries, it starts to reek of marijuana, in the absolute best way! By far the closest fragrance to the smell of marijuana I have ever tried, and I absolutely LOVE it!

Most of all I wanted something that had continued to develop creatively from the 80s down an imagined path of an unregulated fragrance industry and so would feel like a full-fat classic with a modern twist. \n\r\nAll Rogue Perfumery fragrance releases to date are Non-IFRA compliant so are as full-fat as you can get. Mousse Illuminee was all about a sweet resinous moss (in this instance treemoss). It was exactly what I had been searching for, so much so I was speechless for a good twelve minutes whilst I was in heaven and my mind was trying to deconstruct this magical scent.\n\r\nHow would I describe it? Imagine going for a walk on a clear night, through a green damp forest but with a silvery luminosity provided by a full moon overhead. That combined with the earthy scent of fallen logs and the foliage underfoot. Sweet, spicy and slightly floral with a herbal and resinous undertone I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Rich frankincense and something akin to bay added to the already ethereal aroma to join this mystical moss. \n\r\nTwo sprays will last the day, project plenty and easily fill a room. \n\r\nRarely does something click so completely and I was so completely bowled over by it I bought Mousse Illuminee immediately after smelling it for the first time from a sample....I should have bought more. This is not only full bottle worthy but could effortlessly become someones signature scent. Absolutely stunning. \r\nBravo Rogue Perfumery, Bravo Manuel. ",

As the composition moves to its early heart, the lush white floral jasmine becomes the focal point, with slightly powdery co-staring yellow floral ylang-ylang and significant mossy green oakmoss rising from the base, bolstered by the subtle underlying support of multiple culinary herbs.  During the late dry-down the florals gradually recede, leaving the oakmoss to pair with moderately powdery benzoin and slightly sweet sandalwood, with the composition turning leathery late, derived from a touch of (possibly real) civet joining in through the finish.  Projection is excellent, as is longevity at 12-15 hours on skin.\n\r\nWow... Chypre-Siam is a stunner.  It is so classically structured with pre-IFRA restriction nonsense ingredient types and amounts that this vintage perfume lover would swear it came out of the early 1900's if I didn't know better.  The juice is a gorgeous mossy-green, foretelling the tremendous jasmine and oakmoss driven chypre concoction that has perfect balance from top-to-bottom.  Perfumer Cross has many different successful compositions in his repertoire, but Chypre-Siam is the one he probably should be most proud of.  I suppose if ignoring the IFRA, one could yield a convincing chypre, but getting the complete balance down is far from easy and I am sure Chypre-Siam was a labor of love that could have taken years to perfect.  As a grateful wearer, this writer can only thank Mr. Cross for using his obvious talent to keep the true classic chypre alive and well.  The bottom line is the $150 per 100ml bottle Chypre-Siam is a completely successful resurrection of the classic chypre, while still adding new wrinkles to the mix, earning a \"near-masterpiece\" 4.5 out of 5 star rating, and a super-strong recommendation in particular to lovers of classically structured perfumes who lament genre destroying IFRA restrictions.",

Thought of in terms of colour, this one is a yellowy green, whereas VT is more of a golden brown. What they do have in common, however, is a total absence of tobacco, at least on my skin. My preferred choice between the two would be VT, as the feel of this one is rather sombre, & it's definitely not my style.",

I am most reminded of the cedar boxes that cigars used to be stored in when purchased at tobacconists. The amber and the sandalwood seem to be there only to reinforce the cedar and give a roundness to the blend.\n\r\nThe tobacco has no darkness, no depth, so I am confused that so many of the Basenotes reviewers here refer back to Tabarome, which for me was a dark, acrid, harsh tobacco scent. This merely hints at tobacco, focusing all of its attention on the cedar and sandalwood.\n\r\nI might have liked this more if there had been more depth, more gravitas, but it is too light and evanescent to appeal to my love of tobacco. I suppose that works in the modern world and does allow this to be considered unisex, whereas a powerful statement would be solely intended for masculine wearers.\n\r\nI think it is very decent, but not terribly interesting, hence the neutral review.\n",

			"content": "Tabac Vert comes across as a straightforward mossy, green tobacco scent that interprets fresh, green, leafy tobacco. It is aromatic (but not herbal), dry, austere and crisp; I don't notice any embellishment, and any note of amber or sandalwood in the dry down (or any stage) doesn't register with me. It is pretty linear on my skin, with very close projection (I'd prefer at least a bit more oomph) and moderate longevity of about six hours based on a generous application. Surprisingly, I get gentle wafts of it if I move about. \n\r\nTabac Vert isn't adequately engaging due to a few shortcomings; I find the composition to be too bare, and I feel it is missing some notes. I've tried Mousse Illuminee from the same perfumer, and that one comes across as a proper, finished work with adequate depth and dimension. I prefer the accord and scent profile of Tabac Vert, and would have loved a 3D version of this scent, with stronger sillage and perhaps more notes such as leather, sandalwood, labdanum, musk or even a herb or two (I'm thinking basil or clary sage). \n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a few things I find very refreshing about Rogue Perfumery (based on Tabac Vert and Mousse Illuminee). Focus on substance rather than PR/marketing/'concept'; a style closer to traditional perfumery than synth/hyper-modern/AI driven compositions; perfectly legible and wearable perfumes rather than unwearable concoctions that seem to plague the artisanal/indie segment; finally, fair and inclusive rather than exclusive pricing. \n\n\r\n3/5",

A combo of hot rubber, heat, fuel, and asphalt.  I know this seems strange but, this phase of this fragrance gives me these memories.

These are my thoughts.\n\r\nFor the first few minutes the opening was bright and invigorating, this I believe is the bergamot note. The opening of Tabac Vert  I would say is the closet in resemblance to VT. The tobacco and pepper starts to emerge giving it a darker and dry feel. In addition, the mossy accord begins to take effect thanks to richness of the oakmoss present in the scent. The similarities are definitely there between the two scents. I do feel that TV is a bit more modernized than VT not exactly the same but it\u2019s not far from it. I think if the average nose were to compare the two s/he wouldn\u2019t be able distinguish the differences. The base contains wood notes provided by the sandalwood and cedar. The oakmoss never goes away in the drydown but becomes more subtle. A prominent tobacco based scent that really connects with the old world of fragrances. Wearing this I imagine myself in either two different places: a gentlemen\u2019s club or at a barbershop. \n\r\nFor those who have never smelled Creed Vintage Tabarome or can\u2019t afford it, Tabac Vert would be a great affordable alternative.

I enjoy that evolution, as, with the Source1 DNA, Patchoulilight is almost biting and tangy at the opening but then becomes a lot more mellow and nuanced in the dry down.\n\r\nLike most of the line, it feels like a decent performer but nothing altogether that special, and at its standard pricing of $195 for 100ml / $135 for 50ml, it\u2019s workable and versatile, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever consider springing for this, myself.\n\r\nI certainly like it as an alternative to heavier rose/oud or patchouli/rose blends, as Patchoulilight feels a little more 4-season-friendly.  Still, it\u2019s not unique or boundary-pushing enough to make me go wild for it, but it does what the Hermetica line seems to do in general in that offers an accessible blend at passable pricing without getting into crazy territory in terms of either concept or pricing.  The non-alcohol method of delivery and Source1 DNA continue to be interesting attributes of the line.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

Unsurprisingly, then, it\u2019s sweet, though not overly heavy.  It\u2019s bright with the bergamot, that same Source1 DNA that has a citrus vibe.  It also faintly smells of sunscreen in that respect.  It\u2019s sharp and sort of creamy, but with the main ingredients, it becomes an overall quite sweet experience.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very interesting, versatile fragrance, good but not great on my skin, at least.  I usually applaud fragrances that are at the intersection of different styles\u2014in this case, a gourmand and freshie\u2014but Sandalsun feels stuck in limbo in between.

			"content": "Amberbee is my first proper sampling of Hermetica since acquiring its nicely-presented, full sample set from Perfumology.  Amberbee is an easy winner and a solid introductory amber fragrance.  Its name is apropros as it\u2019s a bright, honeyed amber, including bright bergamot, vanilla, and woods.  It feels relatively simple and accessible.  It\u2019s unusually loud\u2014flirting with being biting, almost\u2014at its opening, but then dries down to being more modest.  Unsurprisingly, the bergamot, which fosters are more honeyed vibe, is more prominent in the opening, and the vanilla comes out more in the dry down.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a nice offering and the pricing for the line is not unreasonable, at $195 for 100ml / $135 for 50ml (the same for every fragrance), but Amberbee does not offer the depth and complexity that I usually enjoy most in amber/resinous fragrances, and while some criticisms I\u2019ve seen of its simplicity are a bit overzealous, it\u2019s not what I\u2019d personally look for in my next amber fragrance, but it certainly would\u2019ve done well as my first amber fragrance.  As a side note, Amberbee vaguely reminds me of Bath and Body Works Sensual Amber but without the fruit.\n\r\nI\u2019d definitely encourage interested fragheads to order a sample of this individual on Perfumology or, better yet, opt for the nicely-priced $35 sample pack of all 13 fragrances. \n\r\n7 out of 10",

			"content": "Vaninight from Hermetica is a very accessible but multifaceted vanilla fragrance, with an overall vanilla/amber feel but with interesting touches: jasmine, saffron, leather, almond, and cinnamon per the notes list.  To some extent, I can see how most of these would contribute.  I get more almond and leather than jasmine, cinnamon, and saffron.  It\u2019s not too spicy or herbal but has that vague sort of sharp nuttiness than almond usually provides.\n\r\nSo Vaninight is not a particularly boozy or floral, but rather, leans into a nutty, resinous direction while still being vanilla dominant.  Moreover, it\u2019s smooth and very easy to wear, not slightly screechy even during what has been a fairly consistently loud opening for each Hermetica fragrance I\u2019ve tried (with its characteristic sharp and bright Source1 DNA coming out in part during the opening phase).  It\u2019s a good performer, as well, probably on par with the better offerings in the line\u2014good but not outstanding.\n\r\nEven with my love for vanilla, though, Vaninight is probably just a \u201clike\u201d and not a \u201clove\u201d for me.  Surely it has more depth than a fairly inexpensive vanilla fragrance, even a great one, like Perry Ellis Oud Black Vanilla Absolute, but at several times the cost, as Vaninight has the standard Hermetica pricing of $195 for 100ml / $135 for 50ml vs. the Perry Ellis at (often) $60 or less, sometime as low as $30, for its standard 100ml bottle size.\n\r\nAs with most of Hermetica\u2019s line, though, I feel that Vaninight could be a big winner and versatile option for many, and the line\u2019s pricing isn\u2019t wholly disqualifying.  Vanilla fans should certainly seek this out.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Verticaloud by Hermetica (2018) is a bit of a deceptive fragrance by name, as are many in the Hermetica range, being as it contains no oud, and isn't even based around an oud note. Perhaps a clue to this is the use of the word \"vertical\" in the portmanteau name, and indeed the oud note present is in the top, not the base, asserting its verticality as it were. The entire Hermetica range is comprised mostly of synthetic scent molecules and is even alcohol free, presenting itself as a niche-quality line that places the health and safety of the end-user first, a poster-child of IFRA regulations proving that artistry can exist within such a restrictive environment. Verticaloud makes a convincing case for relinquishing creative control to the big chem firm overlords (in this case Ali\u00e9nor Massenet for Symrise), as it does smell quite nice with blooming performance, but I'm not 100% behind the idea just yet. Some people give this house the cruel nickname of \"Nanny State Niche\" since their premise is to be the Volvo of the niche world, but I think they're at least a little better than that.\n\r\nThe scent profile of Verticaloud contains the entire fragrance of Source1 by Hermetica (2018) within it, which is the house's own version of a \"Guerlinade\", and like with house Guerlain, was released by itself as a perfume. I've smelled Source1, and won't review it here, but I get very little of it in the profile. The opening of Verticaloud is raspberry, synthetic oud, and rose. Out of the gate this has that familiar sweet Western-style take on an oud perfume, with the raspberry adding gourmand flourishes. When the heart shows up, the oud fades and the rose is joined by saffron and leather which is very reminiscent of Tom Ford Tuscan Leather (2007), until the whole thing is sharpened up with black pepper and made clean with the Source1 fragrance compound playing in the background. This is best described as a sweet floral woody leather with an oud opening. Wear time is at least 10 hours and sillage/projection is very good, so go easy on application. I see Verticaloud as unisex, romantic, cold weather, and for evening use, but your thoughts may differ. I personally wouldn't get attached to the notion that this is a safe fragrance either, so I'd not use it on a first date.\n\r\nOverall, Verticaloud is a nice scent, sweet enough for the cold, clean enough for those uninitiated in the world of oud perfumes, but exotic enough to stand out from your typical modern Dior Poison (1985) and Dolce & Gabbana The One for Men (2008) flankers, making it a good intermediate niche step up from the designer doldrums. Granted, $195USD is nothing to sneeze at, but considering even the signature line Tom Ford starts at $150 for 100ml and little under three digits at MSRP is worth looking into unless you're shopping a discounter, the asking price for this compared to what you get performance-wise isn't all that hard to rationalize. One bottle of Verticaloud should be a lifetime supply in a well-rounded wardrobe due to it's lack of generalist versatility. If you're in the market for sweet, floral woodyambers with a leather twist and don't give two shakes about names or natural ingredients, Verticaloud by Hermetica might be worth sampling. I don't much care for the bland green bottles used across the entire range, but that doesn't stop me in this case from liking what's inside. Thumbs up.",

Looking from the notes, it\u2019s an oud fragrance with a variety of the influences, and the experience is about the same.\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much oud\u2014a faint, synthetic oud in the background\u2014but elements of rose, pepper, saffron, leather, and raspberry.  It\u2019s a diverse offering of familiar partners, with surely a bit of that Tuscan Leather vibe but less provocative overall.  \n\r\nVerticaloud hits a lot of the interesting spots while remaining fairly smooth and inoffensive, despite feeling robust and a bit daring too, and in that respect, it\u2019s a weird contradiction, but I like it for that.  And with pretty solid performance, it\u2019s one of the better values in the line, warranting the retail pricing of $195 for 100ml / $135 for 50ml perhaps more so than some of the other lighter options.  And fortunately, even though the blend is largely cold-weather-leaning in terms of notes, it\u2019s not overwhelming to the point that it cannot be worn throughout the year\u2014maybe not in the dead heat of a summer day, but it\u2019d work for me in most other cases.\n\r\nAnother neat offering from this house, and a nice way to round it out. \n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

It kicks off sharp and sweet with grapefruit and mandarin. Fairly standard citrus, in other words, but very pleasant too.\n\r\nThese notes fade fast, even by citrus standards. What's left is a fresh, clean-smelling wood base, perhaps with a hint of mint and musk. Bois de Rhodes is a type of wood but I've never come across a fragrance with this wood as a note before. Seems a bit like cypress but with a touch of rubber or plastic. The mint also feels a little artificial.\n\r\nNot unlike Selection Verte in the drydown. Also like Selection Verte, the Creed signature note which I dislike is thankfully not strongly in evidence.\n\r\nNot really much to distinguish this from dozens of other citrus fragrances out there. It is pleasant enough but compared to Eau d'Hadrien, say, it is insipid and neutered. Compared to Eau d'Orange Verte, it smells slightly synthetic. Compared to Cologne Bigarade, it is one-dimensional.\n\r\nOnly one to buy if you are a Creed obsessive or if you want a summer citrus that smells like plenty of other citrus fragrances out there but hardly anyone else will have heard of.",

The rose is bright and blossom-focused with only little of the leaves or the stem incorporated into it.  The jasmine is quite green and bright, whilst the orange blossom adds richness to the opening stage.  \n\r\nThere is a lot of fruitiness in the drydown, with cherry and a young and fresh apple note - the latter is not particularly sweet and as a nigh-unripe character.  A blackcurrant that treues to develop is rather perfunctory on me, and downs in the fruits, the residuals of the initial florals, and in a fresh green background aroma that develops further down the track. \n\r\nThe base is characterised by a somewhat predictable Guerlain triad of amber, a bright and mon-earthy patchouli and lots of white musks.  The patchouli is soft and lacks any harshness - this is pretty much the opposite of Tom Ford\u2019s Purple Patchouli.  Towards the end whiffs of nutty tone - a bit like hazelnut - briefly make a transient appearance. \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, very good projection and a very good ten hours of longevity on my skin.  \n\r\nWhilst this is a pleasant spring creation, it is a bit predictable at times, and a certain generic and synthetic feel of its components prevents it from excelling on the whole.   2.75/5. \n\n",

Heliotrope and sandalwood add an exotic, dreamy base for the entire scent.\n\r\nThis is a pleasant perfume fit for ladies (as with the original Sicily).

It has a yin-yang quality as the iris has that smooth, almost feminine, earthy floral, and the patchouli is...well, patchouli.  Lorson and Cresp are certainly giving a hat tip to the more rambunctious scents of the '70s and '80s, while maintaining the more restrained and safer tendencies of the modern fragrance world.  It lists \"floral notes\" in the profile, and I'm not sure that they work too well in this.  The black pepper gives this a bit of a spicy, oriental feel, but something in the \"floral notes\" -- it almost reminds me of carnation -- is not jiving with the whole theme for me.\n\r\nIt's an interesting fragrance for sure, but one that seems confused to me, and lacking a cogent theme.  This is best used on a cold, romantic evening, as there is nothing about this fragrance that seems suitable for the office, casual wear, or warm weather.  I'm sure that Gentleman EdP has its fans, but this is not my cup of tea by a longshot.  I'm not a fan.\n\r\nI'm being generous with my neutral rating for this, in my opinion.",

Since Lolita Lempicka binned their Au Masculine and Guerlain did the same to LIDGE, I had been left without a signature scent until the coming of the Gentleman Givenchy Eau De Parfum.\n\r\nLate one Saturday afternoon while trying out the new range of Guerlain and Givenchy ( I was working through the alphabet!! ),  I sprayed this onto my wrist and over an hour later couldn't stop pressing nosing my skin as the scent kept drawing my nose back to my wrist all through the evening.\n\r\nThe dominant note is the powdery iris which I simply love. This is a delicious and exciting scent with warm and sweet notes of spice and vanilla. Projection is good and lasts around 7 to 8 hours, staying on the skin for up to 10/12 hours. \n\r\nThe bottle is jet black with a clear lower section and base which keeps it fashionable while extending life to the original-style Givenchy bottle.

However, instead of a full-on barnyard stroll, it also clearly exhibits a rubbery facet that fits the profile of Laotian oud that I've encountered so far. As a result, Dawn is indeed lighter than The Night, but overall speaking it's still fairly animalic as an oud perfume.\n\r\nHowever, like The Night, the authentic oud characteristics in Dawn retreat to the background rather quickly, and what's left is only a softly sweet and resinous woody backbone with flickers of rose petals. Moreover, it's gradually consumed by a standard olibanum incense and labdanum amber accord, and further dried out by a discreet touch of woody amber aromachemicals, to the extent that the dry down after about 4 hours is almost solely a desiccating incense than anything smelling remotely of oud.\n\r\nI got a medium to soft sillage with Dawn and a longevity of at least 8 hours on my skin.\n\r\nFor me, The Night and Dawn share the same syndrome: a fairly authentic oud opening undermined by ubiquitous, uninspiring rose and amber/incense accords. If Dawn was released two years ago, I would have recommended it along with The Night as an example of animalic oud to sample, because even though they're fairly standard and unimaginative, at least they showcase the animalic aspects of oud pretty well and are put out by a well-established brand. However, during these two years, many artisanal and independent brands have come up with oud perfumes either more authentic, more innovative, more sophisticated or more luxurious, and with a more interesting price at that. Therefore, I would not particularly recommend Dawn before other more interesting oud perfumes.",

It's not like this is any well-known brand, but Erik Hodges (the perfumer) actually distills and creates many of this own ingredients and essential oils within his scents.  \n\r\nAlthough many relegate this product to the category of wet shaving, I happen to think wet shaving and fragrance interests intersect.  This is a Bay Rum that can work in warmer weather as opposed to the other Bay Rums I own which I will only use in colder weather.\n\r\nThere is an aftershave/cologne as well as an EDP version.  I tend to prefer the aftershave/cologne which actually has a good longevity and scent strength.  The EDP, while still good, is a bit strong and I think it's a bit more sweet smelling than the aftershave/cologne.  I recommend a light mist-type application when using the EDP.\n\r\nSince I really enjoy Bay Rum fragrances, and this one is my favorite, a 5/5 star rating is what I give it.  It's a fun scent.",

But combined with the traditional bay rum notes, it's actually super pleasant. It almost smells like bay rum with oud.

			"content": "Eternity Flame for Men (2019) is both relevant to the trends and tropes of the late 2010's and also quite a tired style simultaneously, as it seeks to be another loud, spicy, and candy-sweet pickup line in a bottle for all the \"beastmode\" guys doing upside-down stomach crunches while watching fragrance reviews on YouTube. I can see this selling like hotcakes to all the zombies shuffling into a Macy's looking for a weekend clubber juice that isn't Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2013) or Versace Eros (2013), but this rides so close to them in style that it feels redundant to anyone owning them. Furthermore, this seems to be riding a new late-emerging \"fire\" flanker theme just like Versace Eros Flame (2019) but does little to distinguish itself from the crowded market segment it enters. Described by Calvin Klein as a \"luxurious and addictive oriental-foug\u00e8re composition\", this Laurent de Guernec-penned fragrance is really just another sweet \"ambroxan bomb\" front-loaded with a lot of fruity goodness and spice, drying down into a heavy-handed \"woodyamber\" aromachem mash that feels like a goulash of Emporio Armani Stronger With You (2017), Montblanc Legend Night (2017), and Coach for Men (2018), but with none of the distinction any of them possess. I'm not entirely against this genre, but with so many choices that just end up feeling like the same choice, it takes a lot more for something like this than new scents from other categories to win me over.\n\r\nEternity Flame for Men opens with a claimed pineapple note which all the cult-like worshipers of Creed Aventus (2010)began freaking out about because anything with pineapple might be a clone, but this is the furthest thing from the pineapple/bergamot/blackcurrant trifecta in Aventus, and more like the super sweet \"canned pineapple\" vibe of the venerable Lapidus Pour Homme (1987), although without any of the old-school musky floral foug\u00e8re charm to follow it up. Once you get past that Del-Monte pineapple, you go immediately into rosemary, sage, cardamom, nutmeg, and sweet lavender, pillowing out into a spicy blob that uses the pineapple like icing. The base is pure beeefcake with ambroxan, denatured \"white\" patchouli, vetiver, mastic, norlimbanol synth woods, and vanilla. It's thicker than molasses and feels like an amped-up Calvin Klein Reveal Man (2014) at the end, but without any of the complexity in the dry down and a much sweeter finish. Eternity Flame for Men can get quite suffocating if over-applied or used in any appreciable degree of heat, so I wouldn't wear this to a packed club unless you want to clear the dance floor. Obviously a night-out scent, Eternity Flame for Men is thankfully only moderate in lifespan but has monster performance during its time on skin. Just amplified yuck all around for me after about thirty minutes of pretty pleasant fruity spice, Eternity Flame for Men falls apart faster than a sloppy joe on a soggy bun, even if first impressions are actually rather positive; I shouldn't be surprised at something like this selling itself with top notes alone either. \n\r\nI'm sure the emotionally-zombied dudebros this is squarely aimed at will take a liking to it based on the fact that everyone will smell them as soon as they exit their cambered V-TEC rides when pulling up at Club Sextacy on \"house night\" to troll for another notch on their belt. Anyone else looking for character beyond \"performance\" will likely just find Eternity Flame for Men to be another badly-constructed chemical soup phoned-in by a perfumer just looking to get a paycheck between real inspirations, which is how many of these last-minute designer trend-hopping things have gone anymore; see Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Night Vision (2019) for another example of what I mean by that. I'm irked that such a soulless creation comes from Laurent de Guernec, but just looking at the portfolio of Alberto Morillas reaffirms that it's common for perfumers to have a lot of commercial pork stuffed between their real strokes of genius. In any case, it's sad to see this carry the Eternity for Men (1989) badge and bottle design just as so many inane flankers abusing the legacy of that scent have done, as it has about as little to do with the Eternity nameplate as it does fire. Feel free to sample this at your nearest department store counter, but if you have smelled anything coming out from designers at all in the 2010's, you've already smelled this before at least a few times, and likely done better even if you didn't like it back then. Thumbs way down. ",

			"content": "I talked a lot about the whole evolution of the \"ambroxan bomb\" along thicker, more oriental-themed lines in my review for the original Emporio Armani Stronger With You (2017), how it was the \"next step\" up from scents like Azzaro Wanted (2016) which introduced norlimbanol in an incense context versus being used as a \"wood\" like in scents such as Dior Sauvage (2015), and I was quite pleased with Armani's results. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about this flanker, but par for the course it seems to be. All told, 2019 has seen this whole craze of ambrox-overdosed masculines reach a deafening crescendo, mostly manifesting as flanker after flanker, or even flanker of a flanker, with everything from tonka to patchouli being tossed in alongside the ambroxide-fueled madness to make even thicker, denser, and more painfully-linear fragrances that just roundhouse kick you in the face with aromachemical density. Emporio Armani Stronger With You Intensely (2019) could have ended up like any number of those, and been yet another insufferable foghorn like Jimmy Choo Urban Hero (2019), Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Nightvision (2019), Yves Saint Laurent Y Live (2019) or Armani's own Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu Instinct (2019) from the Giorgio Armani line, but thankfully the bean counters at Armani had more sense than that. How much more sense than that is up to you, but I don't think this flanker really stands up to the original nor really does anything offensive either, so it's kind of just \"there\" to snag in enough sales to justify the R&D before another trend arrives to smash it into discontinuation in my opinion.\n\r\nThe biggest difference between this flanker and the original Emporio Armani Stronger With You is the dialing back of the ambroxan and norlimbanol to levels almost unnoticeable (a good thing), but the dialing up of sweetness to levels you can't ignore (a bad thing), with a few key note switches that peg this less of an oriental and more of a gourmand kind of thing. Granted, if you like sweet candy gourmands with a load of spicy notes, you may appreciate this a lot, but it's not really my bag because that style doesn't work for me. The original Emporio Armani Stronger With You is in there underneath these changes, and the scent opens as before with pink pepper and violet leaf, but the cardamom is gone in exchange for a sweet juniper reminiscent of the L'Occitane's Eau de Cade (2014). From there, we get the original's sage joined by a sweet lavender, caramel toffee note, and cinnamon, establishing a gourmand accord. The base is actually more tonka than ambroxan in this one, but the sweetness never goes to that weird Kool-Aid place some others with tonka and ambrox together seem to go, but instead remains more pastry-like with vanilla, amber, and just a smidgen of suede that you'll feel only very late in the wear. This is an eau de parfum so projection isn't huge, but the scent will last, and is best used in winter for romantic gatherings. Any other time you wear Emporio Armani Stronger With You Intensely might make you seem like too much of a \"cologne guy\" or try-hard, as there is no chill with the amount of opacity here. \n\r\nMy opinion of Emporio Armani Stronger With You Intensely is that this comes across like the gourmand cousin to the original, but boy do you gotta love some sweet to get behind this one. As mentioned before, I like the sweet of the original because it's modulated by more aromatic things, but here it's just too heavy and almost like a clubber fragrance with de-fanged projection. Fans of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008) or niche scents like Serge Lutens Chergui (2001) might find some kinship in this as I feel like it sits between those two but with splashes of the original Emporio Armani Stronger With You DNA running throughout, making it feel like the flanker it's supposed to be. The chemical edges are a bit smoother here too so the blending and redolence overall is an upgrade from the original pillar of this line, but the cookie shop gourmand vibe stapled onto the patent 2010's ambrox bomb framework is the furthest thing from something I'd enjoy wearing as I was a never fan of the former to begin with, and the latter is judged case-by-case. Ultimately, this is another flanker that may just go unnoticed by the masses because on top of being more of the same with a small tweak as this style seems to go, it also isn't heavily marketed or widely available outside Europe or Armani boutiques. Y Live by Yves Saint Laurent is another such \"under the radar\" kind of flanker that hasn't gotten much push, and I am starting to wonder if these things are becoming increasingly regional in distribution, or if houses test smaller markets before optioning for global releases of flankers anymore. If you're a fan of the first one and get a chance to sniff it, go in with an open mind, but don't get your hopes up. Neutral. ",

A fact clearly acknowledged by the advertising : a statuesque womans head in pen and ink, staring out of the page, eyeless. \r\nAnd underneath, it bears the caption Are you her type? \n\r\nAnd many people aren't. At first it can be difficult to know what to feel about this strange mixture of peaches & cream and dark mossy chypre. \n\r\nMitsouko is the exquisite perfection of Coty's prototype, his rather brusque invention of resins, patchouli and moss. Jacques Guerlain's masterstroke was to soften and balance this fauvist invention by adding a milky peach accord, giving Mitsouko a harmonic but dissonant contrast between the two parts : an almost brutally masculine base - decorated with a gorgeous feminine theme. Not a very complex perfume but a surely audacious one. \n\r\nThere is little else like it, especially these days, and this unfamiliarity only increases Mitsouko's outlandish feel to the perfume novice. I myself bought it, sold it, and only picked it up again much later, an old sample from a flea market finally correcting this glaring hole in my collection.\n\r\nLike all the original chypres that have survived to this day Mitsouko's message hasn't been lost, but her timbre and nuances have changed; without oakmoss she now speaks in a different tone of voice. So it's pointless me trying to describe Mitsouko, you'll just have to go and try it for yourself, and see if she's really your type - or not.\n\r\n*****\n",

Whilst there is an initial glimpse of bergamot brightness, quite soon the iris takes over and plays the central role on this olfactory stage.  \n\r\nFurther into the drydown an impression of jasmine is added, as well as a tone impression.  The rose is of medium brightness and quite smooth.  The florals are in control here, but this all is linked together by a nice clove.  With just a touch of spiciness, the clove aroma drenches the florals and provides a very good balancing act, resulting  in the whole being very balanced and never really very sweet.  A subtle powderiness is present too. \n\r\nThe base is characterised by the combination of a fairly restrained vanilla/tonka note, which again is not particularly sweet.  A subtle oakmoss is there too, but is is rather perfunctory on my skin.  The other main contributor is a labdanum and works very well with the vanilla core.  Moments of a soft vetiver provide additional Flimmers of light.  \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, very good projection and eight hours of longevity on my skin.  \n\r\nThis EDT, which is a good scent for spring, is less complex than the EdP, but in itself is a very good rendition of the theme.

I\u2019ve come to really love amber and resins in general as fragrant notes and I\u2019m often keen to try an amber when it\u2019s the first amber-named or amber-centric fragrance from a house.  In this case, Amber Kiso was released simultaneously with Amber Teutonic.\n\r\nAmber Kiso has a mainly dry, woody, animalic feel, not so much the sweet, creamy side of amber that otherwise makes it gourmand-leaning.  This is not a gourmand, nor is it even particularly sweet.  There is, however, a not of maple, so there\u2019s a sort of resinous sweetness in addition to just the incense vibe that is evident from the opening.  There are also woody and earthy notes of cypress, patchouli, and moss.  \n\r\nPerhaps the most noticeable additional accord is leather, though, as Amber Kiso comes off like an amber/leather mix from the onset.  There are hints of Bowmakers in it, too, a sense of varnish, leather, woods, and sharpness that foster a similar vibe, or at least the strong suggestion that the two fragrances are in the same family.  Bowmakers, though, commits to the varnish, whereas Amber Kiso, commits more to the amber.\n\r\nThe pricing for Amber Kiso is roughly the current standard pricing for the whole line, at $260 for 100ml and $175 for 50ml retail, though there are always deals to be had at retailers like Twisted Lily that carry the line.  Like pretty much every fragrance I\u2019ve tried from the line, Amber Kiso\u2019s pricing seems reasonable, not only because it\u2019s a particularly bold offering, but because it embodies the same degree of care and creativity that I\u2019ve become accustomed to smelling from the house.\n\r\nOverall, it performs well, highly dense from the start, not losing too much steam in the dry down, and a clear nice cold weather option, based on scent profile (I wouldn\u2019t wear this in the heat\u2026no sir), so it\u2019s frankly one that I\u2019m likely going to buy a bottle of, but I\u2019m glad I have this decant to try some more in the meantime, particularly as the weather cools down.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

And I\u2019d love it. But this one is truly an amber\u2014rich and sweet, dominated by patchouli, leather, and moss, with a hint of temple incense, dark wood, and a sprig of cypress. It\u2019s less unusual than the description implies, but I have the sense that it\u2019s crafted in a much different way than your traditional amber\u2014I\u2019m finding this almost vanillic sweetness in the patchouli, and more traditional resins are exchanged for Japanese wood notes.\n\r\nBut a traditional amber I still find it to be\u2014that makes it quite different than any previous DSD offerings, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely different in character from any number of other ambers out there. Of the two ambers DSD released (Amber Teutonic the other), this one is the more conventional. It\u2019s definitely on the femme side of unisex, but still fairly neutral\u2014it\u2019s fairly subdued in the spectrum of ambers. It\u2019s warm and cozy, and quite pleasing in the end, but not unique enough to warrant a purchase from me. And that\u2019s coming from someone with over a dozen bottles of DSD in their collection.

But, it's not the \"fir\" coat I was hoping for. It doesn't \"spruce\" up my wardrobe, and I'm not \"pine\"ing for it, unfortunately.\n\r\nThis opens with a tang from the \"green mandarin\" and an overall sweetness that lends itself much more to the \"amber\" side of the name than the \"Teutonic\" side of the name, again...unfortunately for me. I blind bought this and was under the impression that it would be a very conifer heavy fragrance, but I've worn it four times now and I'm just not getting that. There is also an almost \"coconuty\" vibe. No cedar for me and no coriander. I also pick up a minty quality right after application. In the mid's I still smell the amber sweetness along with a melange of green, but it's an undefined greenness to my nose. The base goes along pretty much the same for me and that's about it. If pressed I'd say I get more of a musk vibe in the base than the other listed notes. I'm sad because I was hoping this would be a bright and vibrant fir and pine fragrance. Ah well, I bought a full bottle so I'm gonna try and let it grow on me as I generally love David Seth Moltz work and this is by no means a bad fragrance. It's very interesting actually...just not what I was hoping for and so it's a neutral so far for me.",

			"content": "D.S. & Durga Amber Teutonic was released in 2018 alongside Amber Kiso and, like Amber Kiso, is dominated by resins and is therefore true to its name.   Unlike Amber Kiso, Amber Teutonic is not a heavy-handed smoky amber/leather mix, but rather an herbal, green, semi-spicy amber, still very satisfying, and slightly sweeter than Amber Kiso. Amber Teutonic is more for everyone, I\u2019d say, than Amber Kiso.\n\r\nThe main notes I detect are, of course, the resins\u2014definitely leaning toward the sweet rather than the smoky or animalic\u2014as well as some spices (cardamom and geranium seem applicable) and a greenness (via the pine, I imagine).  The result is a balanced, pleasant resinous fragrances that even those who usually aren\u2019t fan of resinous fragrances might enjoy.\n\r\nIt\u2019s not as bold or dense as Amber Kiso but it\u2019s not too far off, in fairness.  Even a small Luckyscent dabber proved to be a reasonable way to enjoy the fragrance on wrists and neck, so I\u2019ll need to retry it some more.  Overall, I quite like it, though I wouldn\u2019t quite yet say that I love it.  Maybe that\u2019ll change.\n\r\nThe retail pricing for Amber Teutonic is the current standard D.S. & Durga pricing of $260 for 100ml, $175 for 50ml, available at not only the house website but also boutiques like Luckyscent and Twisted Lily as well as department stores like Nordstrom.

With Amber Kiso, it forms an Amber Duet, one colored deep golden brown and one colored green. It\u2019s the strange Amber, of the two, because it\u2019s also a strange woody scent. There\u2019s a bit of pine, a lot of pencil-cedar in the top notes.  \n\r\nThis scent seems to be about contrast. It starts cool and damp, like a dark forest in a fairy tale but it warms on the skin\u2014 I think Helena Fitzgerald of the drydown said it was like a cabin in the woods, adding a fire, after nightfall; I\u2019d agree with her\u2014 and, as it warms, the familiar amber facets show themselves. \n\r\nInitially I loved the sample that they gave me so much that I bought a bottle.  Then I sprayed it all over and had a totally different experience: it didn\u2019t seem like an amber at all.  Instead it had musk, geranium, cedar and incense. It bugged me. \n\r\nNow I\u2019ve learned to go light and the affable character of the sample comes back to me.  I think notes reach a critical mass at some point, where the difficult, indolic fragrances gang up on the ambers and push the whole scent into the ground. \n\r\nGood stuff, nice ingredients, interesting concept and packaging(as always from dS) but I\u2019d say  sample before you buy.

			"content": "Baikal Gris opens with a lush coniferous green woody fir coupling with just a hint of salty ambergris before moving to its heart.  As the composition reaches its early heart, the early coniferous fir gives way to pine-like coniferous cypress rising from the base that takes the fore underpinned by natural smelling, slightly sharp cedar wood and relatively dry and smooth real sandalwood. As the progression continues through the heart phase, the coniferous cypress gradually recedes, as the sandalwood and cedar woody tandem add a soft leathery facet with just a tinge of slightly powdery green oakmoss joining moderately sweet, powdery vanilla in support.  During the late dry-down, the moderately powdery vanilla takes command, with remnants of the powdery oakmoss and sandalwood smoothing things out through the finish.  Projection is slightly below average and longevity average at 8-9 hours on skin.\n\r\nThe first time I wore Baikal Gris the ambergris spiked coniferous open didn't agree with me at all.  In fact, it bothered me enough that I pretty much stopped paying attention to things right there.  I was fully prepared to slam the composition in this review based on the initial informal wearing, but an extremely rare thing happened this occurrence... I have done a complete 180 degree change in my opinion.  Maybe it took me some time to adjust, or maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for the composition last wearing, but today I am enjoying everything about it.  Ironically the weakest aspect to me is the salty real ambergris that gets top billing due to its scarcity.  In truth, the real allure is just about everything else, with the cypress, cedar and sandalwood notes the most prominent.  Also prominent and unexpected was a gorgeous deep, soft leather accord not unlike the stuff found in vintage Bel Ami that reveals itself midway through the heart.  Apart from the relatively benign ambergris, the composition is only slightly marred by its powdery mundane vanilla driven late dry-down. While that is kind of a \"dime a dozen\" finish, it is relatively short, and the rest of the journey is every-changing and highly enjoyable getting to it.  The bottom line is the $195 per 30ml bottle Baikal Gris took some adjusting to, but turned out to be fabulous, earning and \"excellent\" 4 stars out of 5 rating and a solid recommendation to all.

It's dominated through the top and middle by a big hay-like tonka with a personality of pipe tobacco and almond, distinctly boozy at first. I was a bit worried for a few minutes; it's sweet. This sweetness against a wet, vegetal violet is a little jarring, but it calms down, and the violet in particular dries out and melds with the increasingly agricultural tonka (the hay aspect takes over) to give an almost leathery feel. \n\r\nThis is where the saltiness of the ambergris and a subtle smoked fir comes into play, clearly present, contributing personality but not dominating, acting like a strident but appropriate seasoning. There's a black licorice-y overtone here, oddly industrial or oily (as in motor oil), probably a ghost created from this set of notes - most likely a product of the smoked fir. It's just beautiful.

Trumper known as Eucris - purportedly worn by James Bond, and initially created over a century ago - of which I used to own the eau de toilette, until I got this eau de parfum, which in my opinion is superior in all aspects. In comparison to the EDT, the EDP has less of a sparkly blackcurrant opening and smells instead like the drydown of the EDT but from the get-go. So it's a sombre mix of notes to my nose such as oakmoss (LOTS of oakmoss in this), blackcurrant, cumin, coriander, and musk. In the drydown, the blackcurrant becomes much more prominent and sweetens up the fragrance somewhat (though it's very dry still). It's a dark, austere traditional gentleman's cologne and makes me think of rainy days and gothic architecture. I also love pairing this with the $5 perfume oil known as al-Rehab Dakar (a clone of Drakkar Noire); they oddly work really well together. Projection is moderate, just like in the EDT, while longevity is significantly improved at at least 6 hours strong projection. Overall, it's a one of my favourite fragrances of all time by a British house that still preserves their long-standing fragrance tradition.\n\r\n4.5/5",

It's a huge improvement on the cologne-like EdT, which only comes in a splash bottle.\n\r\nFirst impressions were \"this stuff is potent!\". The scent is an oakmoss overload. There is plenty of it in there. Others have commented how they \"can be allowed the release a scent with so much moss in this day and age\". I'm puzzled by this too but it is a welcome scent.\n\r\nTo me it also comes across as \"inky\", dark, thick and mysterious, yet it maintains a certain freshness in the opening. The blackcurrant and cumin are both muted compared to its predecessor, but the association to Aventus is justified (to my nose) because of the oakmoss.\n\r\n50ml of this though is ample as you won't need to spray a lot to get a good long-lasting scent into the evening. Two sprays max should do it.\n\r\nI personally have worn it to work a few times and its staying power is big.

The ephemeral quality is sharpened by a slight edge of bitter orange + lemon zest to add a the sharpest contrast upon first sniff.

			"content": "I'm sensing a theme here - Thomas Kosmala seems to like pairing one natural-smelling material with a fake or aromachemical one (a simplified way of making a perfume). In No. 9 Bukhoor, I give Kosmala full credit for using an authentic-smelling oud note, which doesn't mean that he used real oud, just that he ponied up the dosh for a superior-smelling oud synthetic from Firmenich or Symrise (don't worry, though, because he's passed the cost of that decision down to us poor schmucks - this costs $100 more than Tonic No. 1). I like the way the oud note smells in this composition - it is authentically rugged, sheepy, and full of those matted straw and deep leather notes you get in a real-deal oud oil, but skips the honeyed piss and shit notes you sometimes get with the more feral ones. Whether it's worth it to you to pay $100 more for a polite, nipped and tucked facsimile of a real oud oil is really up to you. It comes cloaked in a sticky, gloppy fruit-amber and lots of that scratchy, radiant woodchip note Kosmala likes so much. So much meh for so much money. \n\r\nBy the way, real bukhoor, which is basically woodchips (not oud chips) soaked in rose, myrrh, frankincense and other oils, and either smoked loose over a burner (mabkhara) or pressed into a gummy soft brick to break off into single-burn 'nubbins' of incense (kind of like softish incense cones but in a pressed wodge the size of a peppermint patty), does not smell at all like this scent. No. 9 Bukhoor winds up smelling like cheap bro-wood with a vaguely exotic tint, the oud note departing the scene with indecent haste for all $275 you're shelling out for it. Real bukhoor is sweet, incensy, ambery, and yes, usually mega cheap-smelling, but it smells a hundred times better and more honest than this trash.

There is a slight musky barnyard quality that you would expect to find in well aged oud wood, especially wood that comes from dense overgrowth forests, but nothing is off-putting about this smell.  No fecal aromas as you might find in Assam Oud or some of the Chinese Oud, just aged wood that is warm but cleansing.  In fact I find Bukhoor  invigorating - even inspiring - with a core of aged wood resin quality that has a \"wisdom won through crystalized pain\" type of vintage aura.  It smells of wisdom soaked in the woods. I have no doubt that some modern synthetic floralizers are fueling this otherwise ancient wood composition.  This is not a complicated or evolving aroma, but is one pure and excellent note of wood chips from a bukhoor. ",

I know it better than almost any other fragrance in my niche journey. I've been testing from my new Signature line bottle which I bought just over two weeks ago. I get bored of the new bottle fast, something that never happens with my PB version. The new version disappears on me fast. It's like a cover song with no heart, a faithful attempt at recreating the original but smelling of cheaper components in a sparse one dimensional manner. If you never smelled the PB version this newer one might do the trick. If money is tight it might do the trick as well. But I encourage everyone to test the old and new versions back to back before deciding as I feel the richness, longevity, complexity and oak moss in the original is worth the additional price of the earlier version.\n\r\nThe original version is a definite thumbs up.\n\r\nSignature line version is lukewarm at best. As that is the version that will be sold from here on out, I am giving this a neutral rating.",

			"content": "Tom Ford Beau de Jour (2019) is another \"reimagining the past\" release for a house famous (or infamous) for rehashing classic styles of often-discontinued perfumes (but not always) as ultra-expensive additions to their Private Collection line. It's amazing Tom Ford even manages to profit at all because even the standard lines aren't very modern compared to what the competition does, but I guess he throws enough bones to the mainstream to make it work. Whereas Foug\u00e8re d'Argent (2018) clearly targeted Mr. Ford's past work with Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Pour Homme (2003), it seems Beau de Jour firmly recaptures the spirit of the \"rotted floral foug\u00e8re\" that is Zino Davidoff (1986). Vintage fans that have come to terms with dwindling supplies and soaring prices of their discontinued favorites are mostly the de facto target of these compositions I feel, as paying $250+ for 50ml of Beau de Jour at parfum concentration may eventually seem more economical than paying $500+ for certain discontinued \"unicorns\" on eBay that once used, may possibly become irreplaceable. Luckily, the style Beau de Jour emulates is still a rather common one among vintage perfume genres, so no \"settling\" for Tom Ford necessary.\n\r\nAs a similarly \"dandy\" foug\u00e8re composition, Beau de Jour dries down to a mildly-civeted skanky musk base, but like with many modern designer foug\u00e8res dodging the IFRA bullet, moves what little oakmoss it possesses into the heart to lead off with that familiar sharp edge before going into a proxy aromachemical base in the drydown, since the often-pasty genuine oakmoss basenote foundation of older examples is impossible under the regulations. Zino Davidoff didn't heavily rely on oakmoss either, so in this case it is less obvious that oakmoss is \"nerfed\" in Beau de Jour than in something like Foug\u00e8re d'Argent, since there is less need for synthetic filler overall. The opening is rather greener and spicier than Zino, with some kitchen herbs and coriander joining the lavender. Sambac jasmine, rose, and geranium supply the rotted floral indole in a similar way to Zino, with rosemary and oakmoss giving barbershop bite. The green opening is reaffirmed by patchouli in the base of Beau de Jour, as the 80's musk is joined by amber and the same akigalawood (norlimbanol) filler as what anchored Foug\u00e8re d'Argent. I'd use this romantically or in spring and it is rather well-balanced, performing just a tad more loudly than vintage Zino (which itself wasn't very loud), but is it really better? Guys who hate synthetic wood bases will assuredly think little of the drydown here, but it works for me.\n\r\nFans of this style likely already have a heavy stock of their vintage favorites including the oft-referenced Zino Davidoff, and younger guys looking for hipster cred but unwilling to research or try the classics might get duped into this, but I don't feel any cynicism here like I did with the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" that is Lavender Extr\u00eame (2019). Ultimately, only Tom Ford disciples really buy heavily into the Private Collection outside of the popular selections within it, and Beau de Jour will mostly be entering the collections of folks who fit that bill. It is labeled unisex, but anyone who smells Beau de Jour and knows what it copies will realize who is going to buy it, but all context aside, a floral foug\u00e8re like this will smell nice on anyone. If you have the coin to afford this house and appreciate what Tom Ford does by reinventing the wheel, this is for you. For everyone else, I'd just search for a bottle of Zino Davidoff, as it is still made, smells nearly identical since it is the originator of this style, and performance-for-dollar simply makes more sense. Thumbs up for execution, but like most Tom Ford Private Collection vintage homages, the jury is still out on value.",

There are a few other additives but these are the main players that factor into my perception of the fragrance.\n\r\nAgain, to compare to FDA, as there's a natural sort of continuity, BDJ is sharper and a little more challenging to wear, but feels more like an \"daytime all-day\" fragrance, while FDA feels more apropos at night, and is slightly sweeter and overall easier to wear.\n\r\nMoreover, BDJ, like, FDA, is a great performer, not in the uppermost tier of the Tom Ford Private Blend line (a high standard, for something, like Tobacco Vanille).\n\r\nAnd, at $235 for 50ml, it's good that interesting new offerings are still in what is the LOWER tier of pricing for Private Blends, contra the higher end at $320 for 50ml.  There are plenty of deals to be had on secondary markets or Facebook enthusiast groups.\n\r\nOverall, a great release, and I hope to see more like these from Tom Ford, though I wonder how many they can realistically churn out like this and FDA without being too redundant.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

			"content": "The \"lime craze\" was an interesting phenomenon of the mid 20th century among men's grooming, with a dozen or more large-scale drugstore cosmetics brands all putting out lime-scented flankers of popular fragrances or entirely bespoke lime creations under the brand. Most of these came out in the 1960's and by the end of the 1970's were mostly gone from production, while all of them followed loosely in the footsteps of the original Royall Lyme of Bermuda (1957), which arguably started it all. Avon Island Lime (1965) appeared smack-dab in the thick of the craze, and was an aftershave lotion just like Royall Lyme, had more depth, sophistication, and approachability than the Royall Lyme, but because it's Avon and was released just prior to the explosive success of Wild Country (1967), never achieved widespread acceptance beyond the usual Avon customer base at the time, even though Island Lime did have a respectable run. The usual soap and shaving accoutrements accompanied Avon Island Lime as well, and the primary difference between it and all other lime fragrances circulating at the time was its subtle sweetness.\n\r\nMost lime-scented flankers and standalone lime scents copied the dry, unforgiving tartness of the original Royall Lyme of Bermuda, or factored it into a pre-existing composition, but Avon sought to \"Americanize\" the formula by softening it so \"Middle America Factory Dad\" wouldn't have a conniption when trying it. The mild \"Denny's dinner interpretation\" of the classic tropical accord is deceptively complex however, and it won't blow anyone's mind but also won't offend. I think it could almost go without saying that this opens with lime, but it's a slightly sweeter and juicier lime than most examples from the period, although this is far from \"modern sweet\", Avon Island Lime is definitely not the usual sharp or dry lime scent one might expect from something made in 1965. From that opening, Avon Island Lime moves into a bit of geranium in the heart, before finishing as a skin scent of cedar, vetiver, dry patchouli, and oakmoss. Wear time doesn't go past 3 hours, but because of the dry patchouli, Avon Island Lime layers surprisingly well with modern masculines like Terre d'Herm\u00e9s (2008), where the herbaceous patchouli isn't rounded out with benzoin or civet into something animalic or heady like in classic patchouli masculines that you might expect to pair better with Island Lime.\n\r\nI don't expect anyone to run out and try something created for a short-lived fragrance fad generations ago, and lime in the 21st century is an extremely acquired taste, particularly given that it's a fleeting note most difficult to build a lasting fragrance around, but for hipsters and older guys who remember this style, it might be worth a cursory look just for kicks. Avon Island Lime never had a single standard packaging, but the debut bottle had a pretty wicker motif (similar to Houbigant), while later bottles came in the usual shapes of green glass and also vehicular novelty decanters. Prices fluctuate wildly depending on who is selling, but there is plenty left in the wild to find it for prices only a little higher than the typical boutique aftershave, so there's that. I give Island Lime a thumbs up, and although it is far from the best of the period, it's certainly one of the more unique things I've seen in this vein, if only because of its comparatively mild temperament. Like the previous year's Avon Blue Blazer (1964), Avon Island Lime is more for the hardcore drugstore or wet shaving collector, but a good snapshop of \"where things were\" for American guys getting their Avon fix in the year the Beatles invaded our shores.

			"content": "Avon 'Vigorate (1957) is such an odd bird, especially for the 1950's, and it's really no wonder this second attempt at a men's fragrance from Avon was completely forgotten once they measured more success with guys in the 1960's. By 1957, only Arden had followed Avon into the male fragrance market of all the US giants, and Revlon's entry was still a year away, but lower-cost Italian imports like Acqua di Selva (1949) and Pino Silvestre (1955) were starting to take up some market space in the US drugstore circuit, whereas only high-end French options like Chanel, Rochas, and Caron had much impact in the US previously. Avon for Men (1949) had done well enough, but Avon has always been about pushing variety or \"new and exciting\" items to maintain interest, so I think it's best to put it into Avon's own antique words with this one: \"Invigorating - as it's name says. A lotion with bracing, refreshing action on the skin, and a fragrance keyed exactly to what men like - a masterful smooth blending, of clean, crisp woody and herbal notes, plus a briskness and tang usually associated with salty, ocean-fresh air. So excitingly new is this fragrance that it is making news in men's circles.\" Sorta sad isn't it? This stuff reads like a slightly more smarmy version of the ad materials we see for men's fragrance in the 21st century, and even contains a similar breakdown of \"clean\", \"citrus\", \"woods\" and \"ocean\" like most modern things too. Guess we haven't come very far, have we? However, what the text on the 'Vigorate box tells you it smells like and what 'Vigorate actually smells like are two very different animals entirely, and to add further confusion, Avon never really specifies what 'Vigorate is: Do we have an aftershave on our hands or a cologne? \n\r\nSeems Avon borrowed a cue from early MEM production of English Leather (1949) by just calling it an all-purpose \"lotion\" to trick men into buying it, since many women's fragrances came in eau de cologne variants (and would continue to do so into the 80's with some houses), and anything without a defined \"purpose\" was a no-no to the ostensibly practical American male in the postwar period. I would define Avon 'Vigorate as both, because it contains skin emollients but also carries adequately like any other Avon cologne from the period. The scent opens shockingly with a salty vegetal note that right away pegs 'Vigorate as an advancement on whatever underpinned their iteration of \"lilac vegetal\" produced when they were still called the California Perfume Company. There's no lilac here to be sure, just some old-school citron (instead of the later more-common bergamot), and a kitchen herb melange heart that at least contains clary sage and basil, plus some powdery heliotrope as Avon liked to use back then. The base of 'Vigorate has whatever primitive approximation for ambergris they could muster 50+ years before ambroxan emerged, which is probably actual sea salt and Avon's patent amber producing a warm brine-soaked glow, with bits of sandalwood and oakmoss floating about. Amusingly enough, there is a castoreum leather note here that really adds some testosterone to an otherwise powdery affair. Anyone who has smelled bath salts automatically knows what to expect with 'Vigorate, and there's nothing remotely masterful or smooth about the blending here, as it all hits simultaneously then peels away one note at a time until salty amber, oakmoss, castoreum, and sandalwood remain. Wear time is about 6 hours if you make it that long, as this is surely an acquired taste with zero recommended context for use. Avon 'Vigorate is not for the average Avon fan nor really even the average vintage collector because it's so weird, hard to search out, and not worth any high price. \n\r\nThis strange mid-century proto-aquatic \"freshie\" (using the term loosely), is such a bizzare scent that it really is only for the hardcore Avon collector that will likely just display it. I've come to ironically enjoy its quirky \"bath salts and leather\" interpretation of what is now a citrus/amberwoods/aquatic genre we take for granted, but clearly our notions of this concept are the only parts of it that has progressed in the generations that have passed since its inception. I doubt Avon was the first to create the aquatic fragrance concept, but this is one of the earliest mainstream male-marketed attempts at it that I have seen, despite its \"Twilight Zone\" execution. It seems later bottles of 'Vigorate were released as part of a uniform \"Avon for Men\" trio in the 1960's to coincide with the release of Tribute for Men (1963). All three bottles were labeled as aftershave and one did indeed contain the aftershave variant of the original Avon for Men and the other a first iteration of what would later be relaunched under the name Avon Spicy (1968), but the repackaged 'Vigorate (as \"Avon for Men 'Vigorate\"), was the same hybrid purpose juice with cologne concentration. After Wild Country (1967) launched and blew the doors off Avon's sales figures in the men's segment, this and Avon for Men (the scent) were finally laid to rest and the Spicy variant was salvaged as the aforementioned standalone aftershave release, so the oddity that was 'Vigorate lived to be just a decade old before being axed. I will give this obscure ugly duckling an honorary hat tip, but whether it still will \"maintain that poised look and feeling that adds such zest to life\" these days as the blurb claims can be contested.

			"content": "Avon Bravo (1969) is one of the strangest and most painfully dated items in the early men's catalog from the house. In true \"what were they smoking back then?\" manner, Avon decided to release a men's product aimed at acid-dropping hippies. The bottle and box are clearly designed with late 60's counterculture in mind, featuring appropriately psychedelic font, colors, and bottle shape. I'm guessing this aftershave was meant to cash in on the style of the youth at the time, both by the way it looks and the way it smells. Being an aftershave instead of a full-on cologne actually works in Bravo's favor because the way it smells is not something I'd want to linger for more than a few hours unless I was reeking of pot smoke or attending the Coachella and Burning Man festivals in the modern day, being as the Woodstock and Monterey Pop mindset of Bravo fits well in these settings. Avon Bravo was a lark in that it never had an accompanying toiletries line, and is simply a weird standalone aftershave lotion.\n\r\nThe smell of Avon Bravo is that of a lighter, slightly fruiter take on Tabac by M\u00e4urer & Wirtz (1959), infused with some typical Avon house notes. The opening is really reminiscent of a banana peel type of smell that I cannot identify as a known note in perfumery. Anyone who has tasted Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum will know what I'm talking about here, and this note is soon joined by heliotrope and geranium in simple fashion. It doesn't take long for a tobacco note recalling the classic Tabac to emerge, but this tobacco note isn't as \"out there\" since Avon flanks it with amber, oakmoss, and hay-like coumarin, with a peck of musk. Overall, the composition is oddly fruity and musky for something from the end of the 60's, but if this truly was meant for hippies (assuming any actually shaved), then the smell makes sense. Three hours tops of close sillage like most Avon aftershaves is what you get here, and folks who love Tabac may want to consider layering this to give it a brighter, happier mood lift. Outside of that, I can't think of a proper context for this goofy stuff.\n\r\n1969 was a really bizzare year for Avon, as this was the same year Excalibur (1969) and Structured for Man (1969) were also released. It's like they were trying to capitalize on the popularity of Wild Country (1967) so hard, that any old half-baked theme (like King Arthur or a man's vanity set) passed muster and was tossed into production, so it's of little wonder that a pink, yellow, black, and red aftershave that looked like something Syd Barrett from early Pink Floyd would wear made its way into the catalog. On the bright side, you won't smell like anyone else wearing banana tobacco and baby powder aftershave, so for the obstinant non-conformists walking the earth in the 21st century, digging up a bottle won't be hard. Only the name \"Bravo\" itself seems lackluster, and if you don't like the embarrassingly loud packaging, it also comes in bowling pins, mailboxes, and golf caddies. Thumbs up for the laughs, but nobody enjoying this can take it seriously, so you probably expected that.",

			"content": "Avon for Men (1949) is the very first fragrance marketed exclusively to men by the house after their name change from The California Perfume Company, and the first that wasn't a bay rum or lilac vegetal variant. Sadly, Avon for Men is almost lost to the ravages of time because there is little documentation on it outside photocopies of old ads floating on Pinterest, and not even Avon keep much viewable history on what they've produced. In the greater scheme of things, Avon for Men probably isn't all that important outside fans of the house, but it represents one of the earliest examples of a fragrance marketed exclusively to men in the US, a market that had been very resistant to male adoption of perfume outside toiletries like aftershave. Avon for Men launched concurrently with MEM's English Leather (1949) and Rochas' Moustache (1949), but both of those were comparatively high-end options initially (depsite it being hard to believe English Leather was ever considered expensive, it did first appear in department stores), while the Avon had a huge installed customer base in rural \"Middle America\" much like Sears. This should have meant that a lot of American guys postwar had their first experience with perfume using Avon for Men, but somehow they didn't. What happened? Well, that's hard to judge exactly, but educated guesses point to drugstore aftershaves like Skin Bracer (1931) and Aqua Velva Ice Blue (1935) being too dominant, on top of every WWII veteran's favorite: Old Spice (1937). Packing your fragrance in with military rations is one surefire way to crush the competition, and Avon likely couldn't contend with that kind of leverage despite their market saturation.\n\r\nThe smell of Avon for Men is a rather simple barbershop-style composition with little fuss or development. Avon for Men had that \"dad's cologne\" aesthetic thanks to it's now-outdated lavender/geranium/oakmoss/tonka focus, but in 1949 this kind of extremely basic foug\u00e8re accord wasn't considered so, since the only place you were getting it outside this here Avon was from a fancy imported bottle of Foug\u00e8re Royale (1882), Caron Pour Un Homme (1934) or Dana Canoe (1936). Dry English lavender and bright geranium open Avon for Men, and you can add Menthol to that mix if you're using the aftershave variant, with an oddly feminine heliotrope note floating in behind. Avon was fond of abusing heliotrope in those mid-century years, alongside their ever-present amber, which makes a show in the base. There really are no heart notes to this, and much like Guerlain Jicky (1889), this just collapses into the base after an hour. Oakmoss, amber, sandalwood, hay-like coumarin, and some semi-animalic nitromusks finish off the scent, but expect much less musk in the aftershave version as it wasn't meant to carry long. Avon colognes were every bit eau de cologne back in those days too, so wear time doesn't go much past 6 hours, but layering the brighter aftershave with the rounder cologne and associated talc will bring the performance up to modern eau de toilette standards; early Avon products for men feel like they were meant to be layered together from my experience, which feels like a cop-out to get more cash in the modern day, but this stuff sold for peanuts so it doesn't feel unexpected. If you're daring to wear this in the current century, your best bet is using it after a wet shave on the weekend, or for casual meetings with friends and errands.\n\r\nAvon for Men was originally pushed by some pretty big names throughout the 1950's, with baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and acclaimed dramatic actor James Stewart among the two biggest faces featured wearing the stuff in printed ads found in popular magazines of the day. This was just before Avon began their famous \"Ding Dong, Avon Calling\" TV commercials, so Avon for Men perhaps was too early for the kind of knock-out success it really needed. Nonetheless, Avon got the jump on fellow American cosmetic giants like Revlon and Arden, who would both follow suit into the 50's, likely after seeing Avon's modest success and realizing there was a market for exclusively-male fragrance lines. Avon for Men would be downgraded to just aftershave after 1963, when Tribute for Men (1963) effectively replaced it as the marquee line of a newly-created \"Avon for Men\" sub-label that would house all future masculine fragrances into the 1970's. Wearing the debut eponymous Avon masculine fragrance is like wearing a snapshot in time, and the stuff is every bit safe and conservative as the modern fresh foug\u00e8res that carry the same purpose in the 21st century. Diptyque Geranium Oderata (2014) is about as close as one can get in the modern age, and being niche, means you're paying $150 for the same experience Aunt Mabel used to bring to your doorstep for chump change. Of course I'm giving this a thumbs up, but more so as an early pioneer of mainstream masculine fragrance for market that didn't know it wanted such a product, and for still being nothing if not \"keyed to the masculine taste\" like the old ads used to say, whatever that's supposed to mean. Funny how something once so common and almost pedestrian has become a rarified and almost exotic experience within a few generation's time. ",

			"content": "Avon Blue Blazer (1964) was an early example of Avon's many demographic explorations within the realm of masculine fragrance at a time when an exclusive male fragrance itself was considered exploring a new market. Granted, most of these experiments were loveably quirky or fascinatingly esoteric failures in the long run, but it's funny to see a company with a reputation for being droll and pedestrian like Avon so eager to custom-tailor its offerings so early on, exploring concepts we now take for granted decades ahead of other, often much more-esteemed houses. Blue Blazer is in effect, a youth-oriented line designed to attract interest from male teens and yoing adults. The line uses a posh private school aesthetic with a coat of arms, a sporty and monolithic square bottle with a dynamic logo, and the obvious reference to the school uniform in the name itself. Original ads featured a handsome, smart-looking graduate in his alum uniform, showing a full toiletries line including after shave lotion, shaving accessories, soap, and talc. Unfortunately, Blue Blazer never had cologne released in its brief initial run, but later an eau de toilette fragrance was revived for the South American market, but with little to no outside access to Avon in those markets, I can't confirm it's the same scent. This of course brings me to the scent itself. What is it? Why did this bomb so hard and disappear? Well, those answers won't surprise you, but what will is the fact that Avon had such a disconnect on what the demographic they were targeting would like, that the product they offered was almost diametrically opposed to its own purpose, which is comical to say the least.\n\r\nBlue Blazer was at its core, a clone of Caswell-Massey Jockey Club (1840), which is a dandy floral that is the furthest thing from youthful even in 1964. For those who haven't smelled classic Jockey Club, we'll get to what this means in a second, but for those who know Jockey Club, it's literally the polar opposite of \"cool\" (but extremely charming for what it is). Blue Blazer opens similarly, with bergamot, jasmine, and geranium. A key difference between Blue Blazer and Jockey Club right off the bat is Blue Blazer's lack of a tart lime, and the addition of soft heliotrope to the floral heart which follows. A slight iris and ylang-ylang fade in until that trademark Avon amber shows up alongside oakmoss, sandalwood, and musk. The overall effect is a milder, sweeter, muskier, and rounder iteration of the primary 19th century dandy floral that Jockey Club represents, moving away from the early \"sporty\" piquant flair of the Caswell-Massey into something more \"barbershop\" and palatable for a mid 20th century man. As you might guess, this stuff fades from skin in only a few hours for being at aftershave strength, and has little sillage. A mature man probably would have loved this, but also probably kept away and used Avon Tribute for Men (1963) instead because that line was \"for him and not his son\". Guys are such funny creatures sometimes, but regardless, this is definitely a business/casual affair in tone, albeit old-school (even for the time). I give this an honorary thumbs up, but Blue Blazer is really essential only to the hardest of hardcore vintage drugstore cologne guys, since this layers well with real Caswell-Massey Jockey Club after a shave and a shower. I wish examples of the shaving cream survived in usable condition, because I bet that would smell really nice, although the soap does turn up and you can shave with it if you use a bowl and brush.\n\r\nI can imagine 1960's CISHET teen guys in middle America shaving for the first time used whatever common products their dads had lying around, and were too busy working on bikes, chasing that varsity letter, the girl next door, looking into their dream jobs and just being boys in general, to be bothered with the idea that they needed a special grooming line just for them, let alone using one that smelled like Grandpa. Blue Blazer died a quick death, is a little under the radar for it, but since it's a clone of a currently-available scent (albeit in an upgraded \"niche quality\" format as of 2017), it makes zero sense to hunt this down. What's more discouraging is Blue Blazer became one of the few vintage Avons targeted by \"rare discontinued\" scalpers on eBay (when there's more than plenty in the wild), so prices for it come close to what you'd pay for a brand like Chanel or Dior at retail, which is certainly not worth it for a cheapo knockoff aftershave version of something with much better quality still available and sold at the same price today. Yet, Avon collectors might see the worth in it for the kitsch value (like myself), and Blue Blazer did appear in a few novelty decanters that fly further under the radar on eBay than the stock bottle, so if you don't need the original presentation, you can check it out for a fairer price. In conclusion, Blue Blazer was a perplexing attempt to court a market segment that didn't yet exist, and wouldn't until shopping malls and suburban decadence crept consumerism and materialism further into American culture, making young guys desire brands catering to their egos and interests. By the time this all came to pass, Avon had already taken a backseat to designer fragrances.",

			"content": "This is a very good release from Mercedes, regardless of what age group it's best suited for (though I agree with the reviewer below that it's probably best for the 30 and up crowd). The cypress accord is rich and spicy, and it rests nicely over the smooth, rounded woody base. Private reminds me a lot of Oud Malaki, another underrated little gem from Chopard. Overall, this is a spicy woody fragrance with a dark amber hue running through it creating a fragrance that is sophisticated, and somewhat mature and serious. It's definitely more of a business fragrance or personal scent than anything to wear to a club or on a date, especially if you're young. Still, I have to hand it to Mercedes, they didn't miss a step here. The whole composition has good, quality notes, and rather than release another men's sweet woody amber like every other company's doing nowadays, Mercedes took it in a more traditional, classic direction and added something to the industry that's more needed these days--an elegant men's fragrance that doesn't pander to the mass market with cliched trends. They should be commended for that. I get good performance from Mercedes Benz Man Private. Final rating: 8/10, maybe 8.5 considering the bargain prices that it goes for. \n\r\nSide note: Ambroxan is listed as a central component to the composition, but I don't really pick up on it that much. Either it's been camouflaged really well, or I just don't understand the note, because I would have never guessed that it's here.",

The opening is incredibly dense and heavy which reflects in the oil concentration, initially I smell rose/oud and spices, there is a cumin note at first that I took some time to adjust too, luckily it isn't dominant and just adds to the masculinity, it bounces off the leather that peek's through the transition into the mid, the oud in this isn't too challenging but is slightly medicinal. Once your into the mid there is an ambery feel of the highest order that seems like today to be the leading accord blowing its trumpet with the rest of the mentioned notes closely followed by. I feel like this fragrance is very complexed and for that reason I never get bored, some days it's all about the amber, others it's about the leather or oud and I'm constantly enjoying the changes on my skin (12+ hours), the other great thing about this fragrance is the value for money, it's a great journey throughout the day and excellent quality, a 120ml bottle would last many years in rotation.",

There are familiar oud partners in this: rose, patchouli, saffron, and pepper.  However, what sticks out to me and is not explained by the notes is the vague sort of fruity sweetness that balance s what seem to be mostly be more savory- or spicy-leaning notes.  I assume it\u2019s the labdanum that does is.\n\r\nI'm quite impressed by Aoud Exclusif, though, mainly due to how balanced and pleasant of an oud creation it is.

			"content": "A very sweet-fruity fragrance with 'garden florals' just embellishing the edges and giving it a touch of a fresh, leafy-green garden feel, though the majority of Jardin Exclusif seems focused on tropical fruits and an almost gourmand, caramel and cotton candy-like sweetness. It's a unisex fragrance but I think that this might be better suited for a woman than man, though with a light application men should have no trouble pulling it off, especially if they wear it outdoors in the spring or summer. It's a very cheerful and upbeat scent, and doesn't take itself too seriously...just a sort of fun, fruity scent. It's funny how easily you can imagine Mancera fragrances as Montales. But what I like about Mancera's in particular, is that they tend to stop just short of being over-the-top and too much to bear, withholding the rubbery-oudy-floral DNA of Montale and instead replacing it with a clean, musky sort of freshness. And while the fragrances are certainly full-bodied and substantial, they're not overwhelming, and usually don't feel like they're trying to pack too much in, as is often the case with Montale. I can imagine Jardin Exclusif as a super fruity, super-sweet Montale with a hefty dose of Rose in the background and that oud-y rubber base, but I like Jardin Exclusif more as a Mancera. I can enjoy the fruitiness, and the sugary sweet notes that support it without getting beaten down by it. I can wear it without IT wearing ME. While I don't think this is a GREAT fragrance, I do think that it's fun and enjoyable.(If you are a fruit fanatic of sorts, and love intensely fruity and sweet scents than you may indeed think this is great, as it provides ample substance and intensity.) And while I can't see myself wearing it on a daily basis of any sort, it will definitely be nice on certain occasions when I'm in the mood for something very fruity and sweet. Performance is standard Mancera beastliness--above average projection and 10+ hours of longevity. Final rating, 8/10, and worth sampling for sure. \n\r\nSide Note: As I mentioned, this fragrance is probably easier for women to pull off than for guys. For men, I think it should be worn when dressed up a little bit in the spring or summer, and given a light application rather than a heavy one. I picture a guy wearing it during something like a graduation party or or a cousin's sweet 16 or quinceanara. Lol....some kind of festive, slightly dressed-up affair outside. A summer wedding would actually be an ideal place for a guy to wear it. But if you're the kind of guy who gets self-conscious about his fragrances, especially when they straddle the masculine/feminine divide, you may want to tread carefully here. A better alternative might be Wave Musk or Wild Fruits, both of which are other Mancera offerings which feature bright, fruity notes. These however lack the caramel and cotton-candy sweetness that's paired with the fruit in Jardin Exclusif, and which pushes it just a little to the left of the unisex divide.",

The ensemble of fruit notes (lemon, orange, blackcurrant, green apple, pear, peach) is significant and has an almost candy-like sweetness.  It's bright, varied (only the blackcurrant sticks out significantly), and overall pretty playful, as most fruit medleys tend to be.\n\r\nThe florals and mixed dry down, therefore, serve mainly to temper the otherwise nearly-overwhelming fruity component.  The florals (jasmine, rose, violet) aren't particularly provocative, nor is the base (amber, white musk, vanilla, sandalwood), but predictably the fragrance becomes less fruit-forward and more nuanced/blended over time.  Still, it remains pretty darn fruity for hours.\n\r\nPricing is $180 for 120 ml retail through standard outlets like Osswald NYC and Beverly Hills Perfumery.  Presumably, like most Montale and Mancera offerings, it'll end up end up with discounters.\n\r\nDespite the slightly heady feeling of the opening, in particular, Jardin Exclusif is an interesting enough fragrance that's frankly easy enough to wear, but I don't regard it as special within Mancera/Montale's immense catalog.

Like Jardin Exclusif, the sharper, brighter spots in the opening are expectedly tempered during the dry down with each hour on skin.\n\r\nIt\u2019s agreeable, fairly well-blended, leaning heavily on the eponymous vanilla but still blending in the florals and fruits as well.  It\u2019s a nice experience to wear it.

I  don't really smell much of the purported top notes and it settles into a very warm tonka-vanilla with some nutmeg in there just a few seconds after spraying. \n\r\nAbout spraying, you'll only want to do that once, because this stuff has some of the most projection and longevity I've seen, especially from your designer brands.

Also unlike many competitors, it smells quite natural and likely won't produce headaches as much as some of the ambrox-bombs. Might be an attempt to break into the Tom Ford (but for a lot less) market, and if the Macy's ladies are telling the truth and not just pushing a product, it's working. If this helps start a new trend away from synthetic freshies I'll welcome it.\n\r\nSo how much you like it will depend on how much you like the tonka-vanilla combo, as this is where this one lives comfortably and tries to perfect.

The rum accord (strangely not listed in the basenotes triangle above), nutmeg and vanilla add a boozy sensuality that has perceived depth. Apple and orange blossom add a fragile fruity-floral touch, with an earthy carrot seed presence ever so lightly accentuating the edges of the tonka bean.

Upon my first application of Armani Code Absolu on my wrist, I couldn't stop sniffing it! Also, I can't stop beholding that handsome goldish bottle, and the potion within is definitely worth checking out. \n\r\nUnlike Aqua di Gio Absolu - which ended up being an overly heady clone of typical men's colognes today, along the lines of its Stronger With You scent - Armani Code Absolu is a legitimate flanker that takes the original and \"aerates\" and deepens it to something wearable and identifiable as a Code rethink.\n\r\nTake the unbridled intensity of the Profumo version, and soften the core pungency by 50%, and that's what Armani Code Absolu feels like. And there is a slight resemblance to Uomo by Salvatore Ferragamo, putting it within tasteful access of contemporary tastes.\n\r\nExcellent for evening wear in cooler temps.

			"content": "The much-hyped and much-maligned Fragrance One: Office for Men (2019) by Jeremy Fragrance was already both applauded by fans of his YouTube channel and dismissed by hobbyists in the fragrance community that feel antagonized by what he represents. I've watched a few of his videos, and I admit the obsession with sex appeal, compliments, or the toxic masculinity vibe of being \"alpha\" that he generally sells in his videos is laughably banal at best, and dangerous from a social psychology standpoint at worst, but for the most part easy to ignore. The man who is Jeremy Fragrance has a long history of trying to sell his own image via two separate failed pop music careers (one solo and one with a boy band), but moved into the influencer space as his youth appeal began to show signs of patina, channeling his own personal interest in fragrance into a career as an upstart YouTube reviewer. Fast forward a few years, and he's successfully used his good looks, smarmy attitude, and expertly-keyed marketing angle to not only become the biggest YouTube fragrance reviewer in existence, but an influencer with enough pull to fund launching a perfume brand of his own. Fragrance One: Office for Men was initially backed on Kickstarter after a false start Patreon fundraiser that ended up paying for his Ferrari (surreal as that may seem), but this second time around he managed to secure Alberto Morillas as perfumer, shipping a prototype batch in a nondescript bottle to everyone who had pledged. There have been two more batches since then, each in a clear and black bottle with a cap that look more like a uniform finished product, with some claiming a bit of refinement to the scent itself between that initial first wave and the second two. So what do you get with Fragrance One: Office for Men? Well, that's easy to answer. You get a fragrance for men designed to be what every shallow, insecure, and self-absorbed overachiever type climbing the corporate ladder wants in a scent: pure performance and little else. Office for Men is all about AI-refined demographic-based research into mass-appeal masculine smells turned all the way up to 11. Someone like the esteemed Luca Turin would be both impressed and horrified by such a cold, clinical distillation of \"purpose\" in perfume, executed to a sociopathic degree with regards to nothing but \"results\". What are these results you say? \n\r\nThis is also easy to answer: deliver the loudest scent trail with what marketing research proves to be the most-complimented notes found in men's mainstream releases made in the 10 year period leading up to the making of Fragrance One: Office for Men. Jeremy Fragrance has indeed successfully created a chimera of the most-popular notes found in 2010's mainstream generalist perfumes, mashing up a bit of what people find appealing in several of the \"blue fragrances\" that appeared in the wake of Bleu de Chanel (2010) with some of the high-end panache borrowed from niche favorites in the \"dudebro\" segment of the fragrance community like Creed Aventus (2010) or Mancera Cedrat Boise (2011), layered over the buzzy harsh norlimbanol (\"modern woods\") blast of Dior Sauvage (2015). Not to be outdone by any of them, Office for Men twists these elements together in a not-so-unexpected way, but manages to stand out from the pack by sheer volume alone. There is no mistaking that this is a powerhouse, maybe not on the same level of respect as the 80's masculines which gave birth to the term, but with the same level of cloying strength as the infamous Joop Homme by Parfums Joop! (1989). Fragrance One: Office for Men comes on with a lot of bergamot, and something almost camphoraceous that some people compare to moth balls. This loud and zesty opening screams \"fresh\" at the top of its lungs, and will deafen anyone within a few feet of the wearer, sending the message clear that you are wearing a fragrance to people across the street. The magic of Office for Men is it manages to be an olfactive foghorn on a level even greater than Dior Sauvage, but because it is slightly more complex, does not drive the wearer nose-blind with sheer chemical linearity. The norlimbanol which is the root cause of this foghorn effect is combined with \"amberwood\" (ethoxymethoxycyclododecane if you need the chemical name), pink pepper, and paradisone to add a touch of rounded, flowery effusion that helps prevent Office for Men from being scratchy like Sauvage but boy oh boy is it loud! The base sort of dials it back after a few hours with standard-issue ambrox super, denatured patchouli \"heart\", Iso E Super, and white musk. If that sounds like pure science with very little soul to you, then you're right, but the point is that the kind of audience eating this up doesn't even care at all about what's in the stuff so long as other people like it on them. Of course, Office for Men is almost comically too strong for the office, but for guys who want to \"feel like the CEO\" when they show up at work by putting everyone on notice when they enter the room, this is just what the doctor ordered.\n\r\nOffice for Men is really just a super-powered generalist scent at its core, so you can wear this all times of the day in all weather types, smelling nice to everyone within a quarter mile. Sillage and projection is without question some of the greatest I have ever witnessed, and longevity is also beyond measure so you'll be scrubbing this off with every shower and laundering your clothes three times just to be rid of it. Performance pound-for-pound is every bit like an old 1980's masculine if not more but made with the modern aromachemicals and stylistic leanings of something designed for the kind of person Jeremy Fragrance videos target. That's to say an over-sprayer who falls hook-line-and-sinker for today's designer catch-all fragrances, worships at the alter of mass-appeal niche houses like Creed or Parfums de Marly for the \"clout\" they deliver to their wearers, but maybe won't pony up $400 for something from them at retail. This of course brings us to price, as Jeremy Fragrances sells his super-powered designer juice for nearly $200, but always offers either buy one get one free promotions, or half-off coupons to bring the functional price per bottle closer to the designers he seeks to outshine. I am impressed by Office for Men for being something so strong yet still so easy to wear, even if the sillage is actually somewhat tiresome, but this is still a boring montage of 2010's designer ideas save maybe the sweetness of clubbers all swirled together into a bottle. Considering the purpose of Office for Men, the almost \"Spotify playlist\" nature of Jeremy Fragrance's own tastes in fragrance, and the perfumer doing the composing, I got what I expected when I smelled Office for Men. Would I buy this? Nah. Nothing here really excites me, particularly not the price, and I have most of the things this borrows pieces of, so I'd rather have my peas and carrots separate from each other in cases like this. In perspective, this shows a lot of promise from a perfume label started by a YouTube reviewer still relatively new to the fragrance industry. I'm just past the stage of needing to impress anyone with my perfume and I don't buy into the \"survival of the fittest\" social Darwinism that fragile masculinity dictates is necessary to live a fulfilling life, but if doing one-armed pushups in an Armani suit is a long-term goal for you, this might be your new signature scent.

			"content": "It seems Morillas can crank these things out with a blindfold on and two hands tied behind his back...\n\r\nNot bad. Not great. But not bad. The opening to Office One is its best part, and I'd rate it a 9/10 if I had to score it. It's a very fresh, somewhat fruity smell that doesn't smell of one fruit in particular, but is probably some variation of bergamot with a little apple or something added in. Regardless, it's very enjoyable, and I was pretty psyched when I smelled the opening, thinking I might actually end up buying a bottle. But unfortunately, the opening lasts about all of 10 minutes before moving into the mid, which it turns out is my least favorite part of the fragrance. As the pleasant top notes wear off, they're replaced by strong, synthetic woods. It's important to note how strong the woods are here. They're aggressive and loud, not appropriate for an office, and even gave me a headache, which doesn't happen often as I don't consider myself overly sensitive to aromachemicals. However, they're so overloaded in the mid, projecting well across the room and coming off pretty harsh and abrasive. This stage lasts about an hour. Office One redeems itself a bit when it gets to the base, which has a smell reminiscent of the top notes albeit with less vibrancy and sparkle, and more of a muted, plasticky smell. Perhaps there's some iris here blending with the leftover bergamot, there's definitely a healthy dose of ambroxan, and it smells nice enough but also a bit generic and uninteresting. This final stage is much more reeled in, projecting a comfortable foot or so, and is much more appropriate for an office setting than the obnoxious mid. If I were to actually wear Office One to an office, I'd probably spray it on in my house 10 minutes before I leave--savoring the top notes at home, enduring the mid during a one hour commute to work (with the windows all the way down), and finally getting into the office just as the base takes over. Overall, it's much better than I had expected, but still nothing great or really important. But in its defense, Office One does make me curious for his next fragrance--Date, or whatever utilitarian nomenclature he's choosing for it. \n\r\nOpening: 9/10 Mid: 5/10 Base: 7/10 \n\r\nFinal rating, 7/10, a decent if somewhat generic fresh scent with a couple highs and a few awkward missteps, which I'd find much more reasonable at $35 than whatever exorbitant amount JF's been charging through his website.",

			"content": "Bought this on ebay from a guy who got 'pay 1 get 2 deal' and was willing to sell the second bottle for a good price. Plainly out of curiosity. \n\r\nIf you are a bit familiar with the fragrance market, I believe there is nothing new in Office for Men that you didn\u2019t smell before. I feel like it is a chemically powered up mix of the recent hits, it is indeed quite strong and lingering for a fresh fragrance. Especially the top notes explode quite strong. Then again I feel I can smell this synthetic dance going on, you just can\u2019t inhale it with joy, like you do with most Atelier Cologne fragrances such as Cedrat Enivrant.  \n\r\nOne can say that it smells like Aventus, Sauvage, Gio, BdC put in a bottle and stirred a bit, however this cocktail itself, to me it smells a bit raw, as if it is a base accord rather than a fully developed perfume,  even though I confirm it has mass appeal and people around you ask about it. This raw feeling I am talking about, I feel in some Morillas releases either, like Gio Essenza. It definitely smells much better when you smell it from some distance. \n\r\nI don\u2019t feel a lot of layers in the smell, just that the bright and shiny citrus-bergamot top notes give way to an ambroxan base. Other than that I can say it smells quite linear. \n\r\nBecause that I believe there is nothing new, creative or artistic quality in the fragrance, I don\u2019t think that it will attract the attention of people who are already wearing and familiar with fine designers and niche fragrances, with its quality. I would\u2019ve said that it could attract a younger audience or people who are not willing to go the extra mile for fragrances but for that, the price seems as a hindrance. Now I am not in a position to tell people how they should spend their money, however I can benchmark. For 160\u20ac (and less) you can get better fragrances.\n\r\nI have the 3rd version, black bottle. But still I can say the box, bottle and the lid they don\u2019t have an exciting look. \n\r\nI see that Jeremy\u2019s fundamental purpose for the fragrance is to smell very good, smell a lot, lingering, and have mass appeal (compliments). Ok, you have them all. (Smell very good part, i confirm it for people who are not that into fragrance world. Still I can change the \u2018very\u2019 to \u2018quite\u2019). Plus he has these terms in his website as like a manifesto, so I am not criticizing him for walking the talk. \n\r\nWhile I was wearing this, yes day 1, I got a \u2018you smell good\u2019 comment. I wear fragrance everyday to job but I connect this comment to Office for Men\u2019s high sillage and mass appeal. \n\r\nI can\u2019t say i like Jeremy himself, but i just wanted to review the juice. Bottomline, there is no reason to dislike this juice, apart from the price, but also it doesn\u2019t have anything to say to the perfume aficionado. Probably intentionally.  \n\r\nIf you like the vibe of Aventus, Sauvage, BdC, and you want it to be strong (both sillage and longevity), try a sample.\n\r\nNeutral: For lack of originality(nobody said it would be), and the high price.",

Smell is definitely familiar, but unique; fruity with a smokey woody vibe. Projection is there. And longevity seems to be no issue.

			"content": "This one is controversial, so I feel like I have to give it a more thorough introduction. Let me get a few things out of the way before going into the fragrance. First of, there's a lot of hate towards Jeremy by people that never smelled the fragrance or people who can't separate the person from the product. There are also a lot of sponsored, biased reviews. If you're interested or want to join the conversation, you'll just have to get your nose on it yourself to form a proper opinion. Especially if you're not a seasoned fragrancehead who is used to high-end, niche quality fragrances. Secondly, this is not a sponsored post. I was lucky enough to buy Office For Men with a 100\u20ac discount code. And that's the last thing to get out of the way; the price point. People have complained about the pricepoint. Would I pay full price for Office For Men? No, I wouldn't, and I don't feel like the quality warrants the price. However, this fragrance is definitely not the first, nor the last, 'niche' fragrance that emulates popular designer style fragrances at a higher asking price. With discount codes like the one I used or the frequent 'buy 1, get 2' deals, I think Office For Men is worth it and I'd gladly pay the 60\u20ac I paid for it again; I actually think that's a steal. A small note on the presentation; I don't keep boxes and the bottle itself is very nice to me. It feels better and heavier in hand than I expected and it has the best atomizer that I have in my collection.\n\r\nNow onto the fragrance. Office For Men has been compared to a lot of succesful mainstream fragrances, and rightfully so, because it's in the same ballpark. Personally, I don't think it copies any of them more than they already copy each other. It opens bright and citrus forward, but the fruitiness fades away quickly. It's not cloyingly sweet, but rather fresh, masculine and overall very pleasant. In the drydown a sweetness comes up, but it remains very mild. This has been compared to Creed Aventus, Dior Sauvage and Chanel Bleu de Chanel, but to my nose, it's closer to Chanel Allure Homme Edition Blanche (admittedly I have only tried it once, so take that for what it's worth). The name suggests it's an office scent, and I can see that, but I wouldn't pinpoint it as such per se. It's a versatile scent that would work in most situations. It won't give you many surprises along your wear; it starts really bright and fresh, and it ends fresh with a hint of sweetness. I'd say there is one main distinguishable feature in both the positive and the negative department. The negative would be the blend. Office For Men can be a harsh scent if you smell it up close. It gets smoother after a while, but it's missing the smoothness of some of the aforementioned competitors. I think this is why most people will have something to say about the pricepoint. With all due respect to the perfumer, Alberto Morillas, this fragrance does not smell like a well-blended mix of very high quality materials to me. On the positive side, what you get in return is excellent performance. It's not as loud as I was led to believe, but the longevity is great. On first wear I easily got a full workday out of Office For Men, which is a pretty rare encounter for a fragrance this fresh. The long-lasting bergamot in this is particular noticable. The performance is full-price bottle worthy on my skin. Overall, as I said in the introduction, I'm a happy customer and I don't even think I fall directly under Jeremy's target audience. Definitely give this one a try if you can get your hands on it during a discount, or if you're looking for a strong performing fresh and easy to like scent",

As its official description reads, it has a fresh opening, spicy mid, and woody dry down, a mix of citrus, other fruits, pepper, and ambroxan and perhaps other synthetic woody notes, as my best guess. \n\r\nIts performance is okay, fairly pronounced at the opening but it dies off fairly quickly after a couple hours, when it becomes a skin scent.  \n\r\nI believe my decant is from the first batch, but currently it\u2019s in its third batch release\u2014take from that what you will\u2014at pricing of $180 for 100ml.

I almost forgot - this is really noticeable! It's so neat, how it lifts the scent - like an Aria sung by a clear soprano. \n\r\nI'm sure I can do a better review later - but I wanted to write something on this while I was wearing it - it is so complex!",

			"content": "There's a great idea in here, but I'm a bit concerned about the actual implementation.  \n\r\nMimosun smells like what it says (mimosa, grapefruit, and musks), but ends up much more complex than the sum of its parts.  The mimosa is the star, woody and honeyed and vaguely floral, while the grapefruit adds lift and brightness, while the musks quietly enhance the animalic nature of the honey tones.  This would all be magnificent, except for the sweaty cat-pee undertone coming from the grapefruit.  At first it's subtle, curled up softly under the honey and woods, providing an earthy balance to all the bright prettiness, but it eventually takes over to the point where this really does smell like some sort of animal has peed in a bag full of decaying flowers and wood chips.\n\r\nSo here I am.  I hate giving bad reviews to small, local perfumers, but I just can't wrap my head around that pee smell.  This is so close to brilliant that it hurts - maybe something as easy as a switch from actual grapefruit oil to grapefruit aldehydes would have made this a potential mimosa grail.  But as is, I think this would mostly appeal to fans of MikMoi's avant garde aesthetic (fresh but gross) or possibly fans of bright-but-funky classics like Czech & Speake's Citrus Paradisi.",

			"content": "Taif rose is one of my least favorite rose essential oils. It\u2019s a damascena rose grown in a specific area of the world and in a specific environment that brings out the green aspect of rose, along with a kind of tart or lemony note, a sort of geranium character. It\u2019s kind of angular, which I don\u2019t mind at all, but it has a built-in bugaboo I\u2019ve always had with the damascena rose, especially the distilled oil. It often has, to my nose, a sort of vegetal note, an old dying rose water in a vase swampy note. It effectively ruins an essential oil for me when that\u2019s present. Taif rose can highlight that note because of its character and bring a sort of metallic edge in also. Many don\u2019t have this swamp note problem. It\u2019s specific to the person. But it makes taif rose a bit of a landmine for me.\n\r\nMalik al Taif has this presence and note. I struggled to smell the rest of the fragrance while this was going on, but had difficulty. I applied it to a card which made it a little better, but only a little, so I could try and discover this fragrance more.  It has a classic combo of taif rose, saffron and oud I would have liked to explore; and see where the rounder, softer note of the Indian rose fit in, along with the musk. On the card, the rose did soften in the drydown, become less sharp, and make a marriage with the musk in a long-lasting drydown, so on some this may be beautiful. But I smelled the dying rose note until the end. If you\u2019re one who has difficulty with natural taif rose, this fragrance may be, like for me, ultimately unwearable.\n\r\nBuying a sample of a taif rose fragrance was a risk, but it was still worth it. Though it\u2019s thumbs-down for me, I\u2019m giving it a neutral for the pleasure of the ride through the landscape of an old-style, non-French fragrance. ",

			"content": "The Rose opening is beautiful.  A Damascene Taif  Rose starts it off, staring with an intense rose note, with a bit later brings out the rose leaves and stems more, resulting in a more vegetal character.  The Indian rose remains in more in the background.  \n\r\nSoon the vegetal rose is modulated by an oud that is merging with the rose pleasantly.  This oud is less loud and shrill and many modern ouds are and fit is well with the rest.   A lovely dark musk is added soon, adding a faecaloid element that works well with the oud.  A saffron undertone adds further depth.  \n\r\nThe base sees the rose rescind a bit, and a resinous benzoin note moving into the foreground. Is has an ambery touch to it, and develops a night balsamic side on me.  A sandalwood softens the benzoin towards the end.  Finally, the sandal and the resinous notes merge to a refined finale.  \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, excellent projection and a superb thirteen hours of longevity on my skin.  \n\r\nThis is a delicious rose composition for cool spring evenings; rich, intense but refined and with good texture.   3.75/5 ",

			"content": "I tested a 1.5mL sample of this. It was actually difficult to find online because there was apparently no name given for the specific release? Most of the reviews I found were for the original or \"Blue\" version. So you pretty much have to know that this version exists and is called \"Crimson\" or \"Red\" online.\n\r\nSo I tried it on my wrists first, which is usually a projection hotspot for me. I was surprised at how light the scent is. It doesn't seem to project much at all, which I actually like, since I wear scents for me and don't like to broadcast loudly.\n\r\nHowever, the scent itself is not particularly interesting to me. I have trouble identifying individual notes, but if I had to describe the smell, it's a nose-itching cedar combined with the smell of a woman's leather makeup bag/purse. I think the \"makeup bag\" smell comes from the combination of too many different scents that are all perfumy or flowery, combined with an underlying soft leather smell. I know my description sounds bad, but it's actually not an unpleasant smell.\n\r\nAfter an hour, I could barely smell it on my wrists. But I wanted to give this fragrance a fair shake, because I've been initially underwhelmed by fragrances in the past and grew to love them (Dior Sauvage). So I sprayed it all over my shirt, about 7 sprays (about 0.5mL). I let it settle down and after about an hour it was a fairly pleasant but generic scent. I feel like I've smelled this before, many times in fact. And even with 7 sprays, it barely projects, so you can feel free to go nuts with this. Longevity-wise, it already seems to be fading after an hour, because I can barely smell it on my shirt.\n\r\nSo my overall impression of this fragrance is that it's a very familiar and safe scent. It's pleasant but not anything new or head-turning. I would suggest wearing this in the hotter months to get more performance from it, and it's probably pretty safe for the office. It didn't give me a headache, but it did make my nose itch (probably the cedar). If someone gifted me a bottle of this, I would wear it, but it's not something I would seek out myself. \n\r\nAs far as age category, I see this working best for a guy in his teens to late 30s. I imagine a guy in his 40s or beyond would gravitate to a more committed, refined scent. In my opinion, this one walks the line too much for an established man.",

			"content": "The joint venture between John Varvatos and Nick Jonas was expectedly commerical and uninteresting outside the demographic that scent targets, since not many guys even in the mainstream realms are going to admit any affinity for a former member of the Jonas Brothers, a Disney rock outfit aimed mostly at pre-teens girls. Yet that scent wasn't entirely a disaster, just very dialed-in to the fresh and psuedo-warm trend of the day a la Bleu de Chanel (2010) or Dior Sauvage (2015), both of which do it better. What isn't so expected was this follow-up, which was apparently released as a limited edition in the same year but now sees a wider release as another Nordstrom exclusive in 2019 (something John Varvatos does often). Rodrigo Flores-Roux was also shockingly not present in the design of JV x NJ [Crimson] (2018), and since he is all but in name house perfumer for the brand, seeing this signed by the little-known Carlos Vinals makes this \"red pill\" version of JV x NJ all the more odd. True to that analogy, JV x NJ [Crimson] is everything the original JV x NJ isn't: odd, risky, a little challenging, and satisfying. I won't overstate how good this stuff is, as it is still clearly very commercial in design, but it is closer to something I'd actually wear over the original entry. All things considered, both of these should have been released at the same time, since people love the idea of equal opposites and collecting two \"halves\" of a \"whole\", but I understand the risk parting up with a former Disney starlet and releasing two new scents simultaneously under said starlet's name. \n\r\nFor starters, there isn't an abundance of citrus and cascalone here to mimick 90's and 2000's openings, nor is there a ton of ambroxan or barbershop notes like sage and geranium to keep this safe like the original. Instead, we get a rather interesting and a little bit confusing opening of apple and rum accompanying the soft vacuum-distilled bergamot opening of the original. A tiny peck of dry \"carbonated\" coffee is here which adds a bit of a callback to Thierry Mugler A*Men (1996), and the piquant nature of that note when mixed with the sweet apple and rum makes for a mulled spice feeling. I don't like the appearance of fantasy notes in the structure, but they don't mar the experience much. The opening is heads fairly quickly into a slight suede leather note and a bit of amber, also fairly dry in execution, flanked by a semi-medicinal lavender that is likely lavandin. The base has norlimbanol, labdanum, vetiver, and a fairly verdant patchouli, not at all like the usual denatured \"white patchouli\" making the rounds these days as a sorta-thickener. The scratchiness of the fake woods accord is balanced by this vetiver with a puff of musk to give JV x NJ [Crimson] a semi-oriental feeling. Final drydown is pleasant if not a bit vexing in development from dry fruit coffee to aromatic leather and finally woody amber tones, but performance is not huge so most of this trip will be experienced solo. JV x NJ [Crimson] is best used in an office or casual setting much like the blue bottle, but has a tiny bit more potential in colder weather, which makes sense when you think about it.\n\r\nI feel like Nick Jonas probably had a singular idea of what he wanted, and two different ideas were presented to him; one by the typical perfumer of John Varvatos that played it by-the-book and ultimately won out, and one that came from an alternate perfumer which took a left-hand path to the same destination, making much more-creative but less mass-appealing choices. Similar to the dilemma faced by Roy Halston Frowick over his two masculine launch fragrance choices, Nick Jonas probably didn't want to leave whichever one he didn't choose to be wasted, so the original limited release occurred. There is really little else to explain a new limited flanker appearing only mere months behind the original, then getting magically released on a wider scale as a store exclusive, if not for the fact that both formulas existed from the start. In any case, I'd still be on the fence about owning this and recommend testing as it doesn't stand out much more from the crowd than its slightly-older \"Jonas Brother\", but the development is much more interesting and JV x NJ [Crimson] dries down to something other than the usual ambroxan bombs or aquatics competing against it in the affluent young men's segment. Solid like the first JV x NJ, more enjoyable than the first, and unique enough to eke out a passing grade from me, JV x NJ [Crimson] is still far from John Varvatos' finest hour but at least walks to the beat of its own drum.

			"content": "Bois Mystique by Houbigant (2018) is a valiant attempt by Houbigant to make something modern male luxury perfume buyers would perceive as relevant to their interests, and feels more like a scent from Maison Francis Kurkdijan than anything previously released by the storied old house. I'm not being hasty and calling this great or any kind of return to form, because it clearly isn't and the house still mostly leverages its remaining portfolio of classics that didn't get sold off during its fall from grace through the  70's and 80's, but Bois Mystique is still a step in the right direction business-wise. For the most part, this is a modern masculine niche perfume based in synthetic ambergris, wood, and amber tones; it is a peppery and slightly powdery-fresh perfume, not unlike something such as MFK APOM Pour Homme (2009) with bits of Penhaligon's Juniper Sling (2011), creating a clean white musk undercurrent in the finish. Bois Mystique tries to be more complex and sophisticated than it is, and has far less detectable notes than listed, but that's fine, really. Houbigant needs a release like this because not a lot of guys are going to wear Foug\u00e8re Royale (1882) or Duc de Vervins (1985) in the 21st century, especially at nearly $200 a bottle, unless they're hobbyists into older iconic styles and perfume history in general.\n\r\nThe opening of Bois Mystique is mostly a presentation of dry bergamot, artemisia, neroli, and pink pepper, setting up a crisp inoffensive freshness and \"clean white linen shirt\" kind of vibe that perfectly creates an introduction for what is to come. I find the scent a bit on the boring side even this early on, but I think the composition works well in the context of the office, althogh most people don't want to pay niche coin for an office fragrance unless they're head of the entire firm. Juniper and cardamom come next, flanked with iris and ginger. There is a norlimbanol note here that gets labelled as \"incense\" but it's not full-on scratch like a bottle of Dior Sauvage (2015) so again, it's fine really. The iris goes well with the spices to maintain clean lines like with the neroli in the top, and all of it sets up neatly for the base, which continues the theme. Cashmeran, cedar, ambrox, and white musk sit under a bit of dry amber to make a smooth cool-playing futuristic \"woodyamber\" vibe like one of your more avant-garde modern niche houses, which is a brave step away from the traditional foug\u00e8re accords this house literally invented in the late 19th century and has leaned on since. Bois Mystique wears well in spring through fall, is quite generalist, has good longevity, moderate projection, and is unassuming enough for casual and office use, but is the furthest thing from engaging to the wearer. If high-quality but pleasantly forgettable fragrance that smells like you have good but conservative taste is what you're after, this is the masculine fragrance for you.\n\r\nThe biggest criticism I can throw at Bois Mystique is the fact that it is so intently modern, inoffensive, unexciting, and perfectly prudent, as if Houbigant asked perfumer Luca Maffei to take his best shot at making an MFK-style fragrance but without any of the personality Kurkdijan brings to his creations. Put another way, it's as if Houbigant wanted to take something like Prada L'Homme (2016) and \"niche-ify\" it by stuffing in double the notes and tweaking the nobs so it smells more futuristic, artistic, and \"expensive\" for the requisite niche/luxury snobs, but manages to miss the point of why most people move up from designer price points into niche in the process. Granted, this is despite also being well-executed, having no rough edges so to speak, and performing admirably. In other words, this smells good, but doesn't grab you. If you're a guy looking to get your foot in the door with Houbigant, and may not be ready for something like Foug\u00e8re Royale, this is a better starting point than Cologne Intense (2015), which is confusingly neither a cologne nor intense. Would I wear this? No, as I have my bases covered with office scents (for far less than $185), but I'd appreciate smelling it in passing and would recommend Bois Mystique for a guy who wants to stand above a crowd without standing out from it.

			"content": "I've had my bottle for quite awhile.  It hasn't been in the directory for long.  This review is for the EDP...  Deep.  Dark.  Huge notes of geranium and saffron on top.  Indolic ylang ylang, too.  The top notes are brief, as the middle notes almost immediately take over..  This frag becomes very woody and skanky.  Then more geranium appears with an addition of Turkish-like rose..  After time MAH settles down and becomes less woody - a tad more floral in nature.\n\r\nI believe some folks would think the top and middle of this perfume resemble body odor.  In a way, it does.  It's very pungent.  I've worn this fragrance enough to realize that it is just too wood-laden and drowning in geranium, for me to truly appreciate.  Some days more than others, the rose, saffron, and oud are just fine.  This one seriously changes profile depending on temperatures.  In the summer, it is miserable.  In winter it is less offensive, more refined.\n\r\nThe presence of orris with touches of violet emerge in time, if one is patient.  There is more wood in the base with touches of earthiness.  An incense vibe emerges as well, even though incense isn't listed as a note.  Winter or summer, the whole thing mellows hours later, becomes more smooth and tamed.  I've had a love / hate relationship with Matar al Hub since purchasing a couple of years ago.  I've decided I don't love it enough to keep.",

The backstory - that the 70\u2019s iteration of \u2018Essence Rare\u2019 was the first fragrance Jean-Claude Ellena composed when he came to New York and that he also composed the newly revived 2018 version - is irresistible.\n\r\nIt still has a sort of Houbigant air to it - that light, joyful, aldehydic bouquet-of-flowers quality. The opening is a light aldehydic spray of green Muguet and other florals, kind of tender. The aldehydes aren\u2019t too strong, and give it sparkle and joie de vivre. It becomes more green as it ages, but with that light, clean Jean-Claude Ellena sensibility.  His style of subtle complexity brings an interesting quality to Essence Rare. It has an effusive aldehydic floral bouquet applied with restrained focus. You can feel his touch. \n\r\nThere\u2019s a springtime quality to it, but it will work other times of year, especially late winter when you start craving green, because of its solid green quality. It also smells lovely outside in open air, developing a subtle amber quality. The aldehydes don\u2019t seem to be a big problem outside, as they usually are. Even inside, the aldehydes have a non-intrusive quality, \n\r\nVery long-lasting. For a muguet fragrance, it has the feel of a certain solidness of construction about it, that says it\u2019s light but not unsubstantial. Though I\u2019ve never been a lily-of-the-vally fan (I don\u2019t have any in my wardrobe), I think it\u2019s a nice fragrance. And very Houbigant.",

But I'm not having to try very hard -- a citrussy green galbanum opening is a favorite of mine in almost any fragrance. I have to do a little forgiving with the narcissus, but it's not overwhelming enough to annoy me, and the iris is soft and quietly appealing. And that soft greenness carries right through to the classic custardy Guerlain ending.\n\r\nThe modern EDT, by comparison, is just sharper in every angle: much more moss, much less powder, and much more sweetness in the base. Again, not bad, but very lacking in that Guerlain \"haze\" that makes the parfum seem like you're smelling it through a silk veil.\n\r\nI don't think I'm ever going to be a fanatic about Guerlain feminines -- that classic Guerlainade base is just not a selling point for me -- but if I were ever to splurge on a full bottle of one, the vintage Vol de Nuit might be the one. Not to mention that its square Deco bottle might be my favorite bottle in all of perfumery. \n",

Performances are awesome, of course. \n\r\nI had the chance to test Shalimar EDP (current version), Shalimar parfum de toilette, Shalimar Souffle de Parfum and buy a 70s vintage version Shalimar, extrait de parfum from the 60s, the first version of Ode \u00e0 la Vanille, sur la Route de Madagascar and sur la Route du Mexique. \n\r\nThe current Shalimar EDP was a bit disappointing. A lot of bergamot with some cardamom and then a powdery rose (almost itchy). Then it settles down finally but doesn't give a good sillage. What's funny is that it smells different if you smell it one cm away from another spot. \n\r\nShalimar from the 70s is so much better. Both softer and spicier, with an amber, cashmere feel. You get the bergamot and the rose, but nothing is too strong. \n\r\nParfum de toilette (mine is from 93) is even softer but powerful with more powdery vanilla.

It also has more fruit. \n\r\nSur la Route de Madagascar shares a lot of notes as well, but it's more floral than fruity. It's more animalistic. Dirtier in a very sexy way.

It is as though they are soaking in a light, honeyed drink incorporated with carbonation.  Fizzy, never bitter, naturally sweet.\n\r\nThe base moves into the heart in no time.  Patchouli is soft.  Benzoin too, is soft and equally balanced.  I only get vague incense for awhile.  Eventually the fougere / fresh fern accord diminishes as the base notes lean more towards an oriental vibe.  The only complaint is, this frag only lasts four to six hours in the air - seven to eight, on the skin.  Reapplication often is a must.

I finally thought I would get to pick one between Dawn and The Night both is oud base fragrance of Fredric Malle. I have already tried the night week ago but didn\u2019t decide to buy yet so this time I tried Dawn. I sprayed Dawn on my wrist and thought about to wait for a while. I then while waiting for Dawn to settled on my wrist I thought of to try Gucci Haute couture fragrance line(I also tried Oud intense of Gucci before but I didn\u2019t like and at the time I tried Oud intense a Gucci sale assistant was not there. Then this time Gucci sale assistant was at the booth she introduced me nocturnal whisper and she said the oil is 75 percent intense and made of real oud wood, she added her advice by telling me this oud oil would layered well with their perfume The voice of the snake. So I tried ANW+TVOTS layered on my other wrist. Surprisingly they share some kind of scent between Dawn and ANW+TVOTS with very nice touch of oud base and layered with scent of flowers. I then find ANW+TVOTS is more romantic and modern but I also tried each of the two alone both on my back hands. ANW alone is a little dry a bit sweat, dirty and animatic. TVOTS alone is a little too sweet with top scent of flowers such saffron and pachouli and slightly base scent of oud but tbh I find it\u2019s not spacial.  In my opinion while sniffing my back hands and wrists I find these two combination of ANW and TVOTS is the best. The scent of the two combined is given the similar scent to Dawn by Frederic Malle but less oriantal presentation and I find the two combination is more contemporary so I changed my  thought and paid for the two combination. If TVOTS alone I would not rate it so high I feel like it\u2019s on different league and class compare to  Dawn of Frederic Malle but surprisingly when the two combination it becomes new experience of fragrance the scent is as hi-end as Dawn of Frederic Malle. I am so happy for my purchase of ANW+TVOTS.  ",

Yes, it changes its sweetness profile, into something a little different.  A touch of salty skin, after a dip in an ocean, too.  Clove and coconut truly accent this perfume.\r\nThe heart moves into a steady flow of tanning lotion & tropical fruit-punch accords.

Rich, sweet at first but it's balanced out by the woodsy-oak base.  Bears some (a lot?) of resemblance to Hummingbird-not quite as floral or as dark as Hummingbird, and more green than Hummingbird, but there are similarities in their composition. Rose and patchouli darken the notes out as a whole as the frag matures. This really shines as it begins to dry down...holy hell: I can picture myself on vacation, lying on a beach with lush fruit all around.

The raspberry disappears a bit more but the lime stays steady and strong, adding a lovely tartness to the scent throughout until it dies down.\n\r\nProjection is above average, longevity is very good.

In the course of his life, he released 40 scents, beginning with the 1919 Ambre de Delhi (a Hindu perfume) and ending with his 1943 Echo of the Desert. \n\r\nHis perfumes were given exotic names, referencing the far East, and containing rare and precious oils and resins.

			"content": "It doesn't feel anymore \"get it out by Friday\" than this folks. I don't really know what to say without turning this review into a string of jokes at Viktor & Rolf's expense, but I imagine that is what most people not entirely brainwashed by marketing will do if they get a sniff of this blind. Here we have a flanker that really isn't one, since it has nothing to do with the original Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb (2012), but that is nothing out of the ordinary in the 21st century since several mainstream perfume houses have long since abandoned new pillars in favor of reusing what \"sells\" by making endless flankers of a successful line. Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Night Vision (2019) goes way beyond that though, delivering magically only 90ml instead of 100ml in the same size and shape bottle as the original for the same price, and delivering a scent that is the olfactive equivalent of what we called a \"suicide\" as kids: going to a soda fountain and mixing all the flavors into one cup and drinking it all together. The commercial admittedly shows a rather attractive nude man being peeped on through night vision goggles from an adjacent window (which is not something I recommend doing unless you fancy a jail cell), but this marketing doesn't even really speak to what is inside the bottle. Shameful...\n\r\nFor starters, Viktor & Rolf are so desperate to send home the \"green\" theme of the packaging and commercial that they are sticking the word \"green\" onto notes frivolously. Green cardamom? What's that? Green mandarin? Isn't that just an unripe orange? Come on guys. Nathalie Lorson is a good perfumer, and so is Pierre Negrin, but they must have just done \"as they were instructed\" here with this, because there doesn't seem to be any real creative input in this scent beyond following the brief as instructed, as if they were micromanaged. The opening is rounded sweet cardamom spice, the only real link to the original Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb, and the orange really isn't there as listed. I also don't get much \"granny smith apple\", nor really any apple at all, but the grapefruit comes through. Following this, it's a mush of synthetics that I cannot identify, but I get sage, geranium, bits of nutmeg, and some pink pepper that is also called \"green\" for no reason. The base is syrupy tonka bomb territory loaded with ambroxan and norlimbanol. There is \"roasted almond\" listed but again, I don't get it. I think there is some serious Firmenich chemical wizardry here, and if this is green like anything, it's Frankenstein's monster. Sillage is hefty, and you will asphyxiate anyone in the room with your \"green\" cloud once you leave, although longevity falls off quick, which is a secret blessing in disguise. Definitely a clubber juice, I can still think of better ways to get your party on than Spicebomb Night Vision.\n\r\nIf this scent fills a niche in Viktor & Rolf's lineup, it is the \"sweet fruity club bomb\", but by trying to be both a tonka bomb and ambroxan bomb at the same time, while also having synthetic gourmand and oriental notes to boot, this crosses too many streams to be anything other than a hot mess in a bottle. Bits of youthful fruit and mature spice, dry woods and office-safe synthetic ambergris with club-friendly tonka and enough sugar to send me into a coma, this ticks off every box on the check list of how to make a modern mall fragrance that people will love for five seconds then love to forget once they realize it isn't going away. There are a lot of modern synthetic mass-appeal scents that I like, or at least find tasteful or well-made in spite of their paint-by-numbers focus group design, but Viktor & Rolf is so insultingly facetious, vulgar, and ambiguous in intent, that it feels creepy like the peeping Tom using the night vision goggles in the accompanying television ads for the stuff. Rather than say to stay away, I'll just say go have a cautious sniff of this at your nearest department store, or likely nearest night club, as I'm sure the liquid equivalent of Herbert the Pervert will be making the rounds there soon enough. If Viktor & Rolf is going to make any more such fragrances on creative autopilot, they should at very least strive to make them inoffensive like many of the forgettable male scents from the 90's.

			"content": "Nightvision is a fresh tonka-lavender fragrance for men with that sort of modern-but-played-out shower-gel feel compressed into what altogether feels like a very blended, singular accord with little separation among its notes and a mostly linear, predictable progression. The tonka and lavender combine to give it an aromatic, sweet, powdered feel and a very abstract green apple lends just a bit of that shower gel freshness I alluded to before. To this end it\u2019s a competent fragrance. It executes this style well without any glaring missteps or out of balance proportions. And although it obviously and certainly smells synthetic, it manages to avoid smelling harsh or chemical for the most part as well. It\u2019s even pleasant at times. I\u2019ve always thought that fragrances of this variety smell best when sniffed briefly, and from a few feet away, so say on someone who\u2019s quickly passing by you on a city street, or someone edging past you in a crowded theater. It smells perfectly fine in that sense. The problem is, I can think of a lot fragrances that smell similar, even three that I\u2019ve just smelled in the past couple of weeks: Armani Stronger With You, Pepe Jeans for Him, and Diesel Fuel for Life. And if I actually took the time to think about it, I could name many more. Even if these fragrances do not smell exactly the same, they\u2019re similar enough\u2014and they all leave the same impression\u2014partially fresh, partially oriental, synthetically contemporary olfactive white noise. It\u2019s the type of scent that makes you shrug your shoulders with an unenthused, \u201cmeh.\u201d\n\r\nOn the positive side, Nightvision does one thing pretty well, and that\u2019s that it keeps its tonka-lavender buzz on the fresh, uplifting side by not overloading the sweetness and keeping it afloat with a light, though somewhat vague green apple note and an appealing, though equally vague almond. These two additions to the whole give Nightvision some necessary levity (the green apple) and just a hint of something aromatically interesting (the almond) Most importantly, they keep the fragrance on the proper plane, making it something that can be worn easily without becoming cloying or dragging one down into a sticky, tonka laden swamp as occurs in fragrances such as Allure Homme Eau Extreme and Azzaro Chrome Pure. \n\r\nProjection is about average, to maybe slightly above, which I don\u2019t mind, as these kinds of scents can be particularly obnoxious when they\u2019re too strong. Still, those looking for more of a \u201cbeast mode\u201d fragrance will feel let down by this, and that tends to be the audience that\u2019s generally attracted to these types of fragrances in the first place. So while I appreciate its restraint, I can also see it as a fault rather than an attribute. Longevity is about 8 hours. Night Vision feels like a daily wear type of fragrance or casual evening wear. I have a few sprays of it on my arm and I happen to be headed to the gym. I\u2019m not embarrassed to be wearing it. A few people will probably pass by and think something smells nice. But no one will be surprised by it, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll catch a few tired eye rolls as well. Final rating: 7/10, which is on the high side of \"neutral\" due to the fact that it doesn't necessarily do anything wrong. Still this one is just too boring and unimaginative to warrant a thumbs up. \n\r\nSIDE NOTE:  This doesn't smell like a Spicebomb flanker to me at all. It doesn't resemble the original in anyway. That signature Spicebomb cinnamon/pink pepper accord is missing and so is the rest of it. Somebody told me they heard Night Vision is supposed to be like Spicebomb with a green apple note. That may have been interesting, or at the least, likable. But the \"green apple\" note here is very abstract (I would never get \"green apple\" from this myself) as is any connection to Spicebomb. \n\r\nEDIT: One more point: You'll notice throughout the reviews for Nightvision that it gets compared to many fragrances, from Invictus to La Nuit to Polo Red and Fuel for Life and Stronger With You. That's because, as mentioned above, Nightvision has a very generic smell. It more or less epitomizes the fresh-sweet aromatic oriental variety that has become so popular for men and has occupied the shelves of malls and department stores for the past 10 or 15 years. While it doesn't smell exactly like any of the fragrances mentioned, it surely smells a little bit like all of them.\n\n\n",

Right now my favorite fragrances are Creed Viking and Aventus, Spicebomb Fraiche, and now it's this: Spicebomb Night Vision. \n\r\nFor me it's an entirely new fragrance. The Spicebomb DNA is there for sure but only slightly. After that all I can say is that I absolutely love it. It's somewhat fresh, slightly spicy, and very masculine. \n\r\nThis is the furthest thing from a club fragrance. This is one of those mature fragrances where I can't see guys younger than 30 really getting away with wearing. \n\r\nDefinitely office safe, light enough for summer, spicy enough for any time. \n\r\nMy only complaint is that it doesn't last very long at all. It turns into a skin fragrance within 1-2 hours but it is an eau de toilette so I guess that's somewhat expected but it is disappointing. \n\r\nSillage is friendly and not strong. \n\r\nFor me the dry down doesn't change very much when sprayed on the neck. On the wrist however it does dry down somewhat powdery so I avoid that. \n\r\nI got nothing else.

In practice, this means headier and denser perfumes with less overall mainstream appeal and a higher price tag to impart the exclusivity of it all. Oud for Greatness (2018) is among the better and more-accessible scents from the collection, seeking to present agarwood in a manner that is cleaner, more approachable, but no less powerful than traditional oud perfumes. I'd say it succeeds at doing this, but draws comparisons to a few other popular luxury niche perfumes in the same market segment as Oud for Greatness. For starters, the bottle very much looks like it's going for that Illuminati/Freemasons secret society vibe, eschewing the usual iconography from the house, and the scent within seems to approach the subject of oud with a Westernized buttoned frock or sportcoat attitude.\n\r\nThe opening of Oud for Greatness is a sharp, medicinal oud note that may or may not be synthetic, then polished and rounded by lavender instead of the usual rose, lending this oud interpretation an odd barbershop-like conservatism. Saffron enters the fray next, and comparisons to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 (2014) happen at this point, although Oud for Greatness is a great deal more defined than the amorphous blob that is BR 540. Nutmeg adds some dustiness to the mix and eventually cashmeran joins the heart of Oud for Greatness, before akigalawood (fractionated patchouli) and musks enter the final stages to thicken and bolster the woody rounded character of the opening. Oud for Greatness is only semi-sweet with hints of vanilla in the latest stages, and comes across very stately on skin, perfect for formal events, cold weather, and night time. Longevity is good at 10 hours and sillage is about average, but since this is an eau de parfum, I didn't expect obnoxious projection or scent trails. Bottom line is this should last longer than your secret society meetings concerning world domination.\n\r\nMy conclusion on this is that Oud for Greatness is a weird hybrid that touches upon barbershop tones, traditional oriental spice, medicinal oud preferred by Western buyers, and a bit of that luxury niche shine to make something that explores many facets of what is popular among male buyers of niche perfumes without smelling directly like a copy of something or like you need a secret handshake to score a bottle. Yeah, you could say this is the oud version of BR 540, but you could also call Parfums de Marly Kalan (2019) the pepper version of BR 540 too, so this kind of reductionism doesn't really serve anyone well, Illuminati or otherwise. If you like BR 540 but find it lacking, Oud for Greatness might be a good alternative, and likewise if you want a high-quality wearable oud without the \"barnyard\" factor, Oud for Greatness may also be a nice option. Whether or not Oud for Greatness, or any Initio perfume is worth the $350+ being asked,is another question altogether, but I suppose catching a deal could make or break the \"greatness\" of this novel take on the subject, Skulls membership not included. Thumbs up. ",

It might even be a very nice fragrance. The longevity is pretty decent although the projection is quite low key. \n\r\nHere's my problem. At this price I really need to be blown away. I wasn't. There is not a massive gap between this and some of the cheaper Roja Doves. The difference is that the Rojas blew me away. If this was \u00a390 - \u00a3120 I would most probably of bought a bottle. \n\r\nIn summary Oud For Greatness offers some greatness but not quite enough for me. ",

			"content": "The opening has a bit more of a sharp, biting-oud than the drydown but for the most part, it remains a pretty linear, soft, accessible, dry oud with airy-sweetness on my skin.  It does lose some of the oud effect as it gets deep into the drydown but I think the whole fragrance is fading away by that point. \n\r\nWhat's interesting is the sweetness, reminds me of BR 540.  So if you'd like a bit of dry, soft oud in your super sweet crowd-pleaser, this could be a gem find.  It comes off more masculine than BR 540 as well, so that could also be a great combination for someone turned off by the sweet and airy MFK fragrance. Sexy stuff.\n\r\nThe performance is very good with solid projection and all-day longevity with minimal sprays.",

			"content": "Opens with an immediate wallop of rubbery, medicinal oud followed by the gradual emergence of a semi-sweet, fragrant, fruity-floral saffron. 10 or 15 minutes later wafts of a sweet, resinous roasted-sugar accord a la BR540 show up, at which point Oud For Greatness has hit its stride, settling in comfortably with a beautifully warm aroma, the saffron, oud, and roasted sugar all working together harmoniously to create a sillage that is instantly alluring, curious, and appealing. The heart of Oud For Greatness is beautiful. Along with the aforementioned notes there\u2019s hints of exotic spice via the nutmeg, a masculine woods provided by the oud, and even some patchouli, lending a dark earthiness to the whole. Sensuality comes via a pleasantly warm musk enveloping the base, aligning the fragrance with the skin. Consequently OFG is sweet, aromatic, woody, and warm, with dark, masculine edges, and a hearty, substantial core. It persists in such a way for several hours. In its final stages, Oud For Greatness is dominated by a heavy sweetness. The resinous sugary accord alluded to earlier comes out in full force and takes over as the other various elements recede more into the background. Whether or not you enjoy this final stage will depend on your appreciation for this sweetness. While I find it pleasant, I prefer the more balanced heart, as the sweetness is somewhat relentless (when still and up close) and one-dimensional. Nevertheless, it\u2019s very nice, and some people will probably find this their favorite part. Furthermore, unless your nose is pressed to your body, you are more likely to catch this very sweet stage in wafts, as opposed to a constant direct smell, making it less relentless and less potentially tiring. \n\r\nI don\u2019t want this last criticism to overshadow the rest of this review\u2014OFG is a very enjoyable fragrance overall and deserves much of the praise it\u2019s received. Performance is stellar, with nearly nuclear projection and 8 plus hours of longevity. While I wouldn\u2019t wear this one in the heat, it\u2019s fine for the fall, winter and early spring, and seems like it would work very well dressed up or even down. Final rating: 9/10\n\r\nSide note: I currently own this and BR540 and do not find them redundant. However, until recently I also owned Kalan. All three together felt a bit redundant however, due to the resinous burnt sugar accord that ties them together. So in the end I picked my two favorites of the trio and sold off Kalan.",

			"content": "Second wearing of Initio Oud for Greatness some ten months after initially trying it out, following its late 2018 release, and it\u2019s still quite the interesting spicy oud fragrance that has once again become seasonally appropriate with the weather cooling down.\n\r\nIts blend is full of provocative notes\u2014oud, patchouli, saffron, lavender, patchouli, musks\u2014and it\u2019s a strong arrangement, with some lavender to add freshness, nutmeg to add spicy, and saffron as a wildcard to complement what is dominantly an oud/patchouli blend, slightly reminiscent of Parfums de Marly Nisean in its general sense but even more vaguely like a Montale or Mancera aoud/oud-named fragrance, albeit slightly more complex.\n\r\nOud for Greatness feels rather floral on my skin, too, as I imagine there being rose or something similar in addition to the lavender.  It\u2019s not particularly sweet but more a spicy woody oud, though not an especially animalic oud, but a \u201csafe\u201d or \u201csmooth\u201d oud, as I\u2019d usually classify it.\n\r\nIt\u2019s solid winter staple, in short.  This is something I could wear regularly and not get tired of it, even if I\u2019m not particularly amazed by it.  As a side note, its bottle is beautiful, the eye reminding me of masonic imagery from National Treasure, clearly a visual upgrade from the other more sober Initio bottles in the same shape.\n\r\nIt\u2019s for sale at great retailers like Perfumology, Osswald (from whom I obtained the sample), and Beverly Hills Perfumery, but doesn\u2019t come cheap, at only the 90ml size for $350 though there are sometime sales to be had. \n\r\nI really like it, overall, but I don\u2019t think I need a bottle, maybe just a large decant.  Rehab remains my favorite of the Initio line, though Blessed Baraka is another one that I\u2019ve wanted to do a full sampling of.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Really one of the better designers released in 2018, Moustache EDP smells nothing like the original or any of its offspring and instead smells nearly identical to the YSL exclusive, Tuxedo. But this costs a fraction of the price (one sixth, to be exact), which makes it a real bargain at $35 for a 2.5oz., and even a good deal at $60, which is the higher end of what it sometimes sells for.\n\r\n Moustache is one of those fragrances that has a lot of notes working together to basically form one big accord which defines the scent. Here, the dominant notes are vanilla, pink pepper, rose, and benzoin. They create a sweet, caramellic accord that's embellished with a subtle and masculine dark rose, adding an element of elegance to the overall composition and making it more than just a sweet, gourmand for men. The accord smells a little bit like the opening of Thierry Mugler's Pure Malt, but a sort of compressed version, less gourmand, and supported by that dark rose. In turn, it comes across sweet, but also somewhat mature and classy. This distinct and likable dominant accord makes Moustache a mostly linear fragrance, with no significant transitions or changes during its development. \n\r\nMoustache has a versatile appeal, and can be worn comfortably pretty much any time of the year save for the hottest months, and is a fragrance which is easily dressed up or down. In that regard, you'll get plenty of use out of it. The most common question about Moustache seems to be, \"Is it as good as Tuxedo?\"  I would have to say, yes, more or less. While the notes in Tuxedo seem a bit more defined and rich, they're only very slightly so, and you only notice upon very close, careful inspection. Moustache can feel a bit more plasticky and synthetic at times, but again, it's nothing obvious, and 95% of people out there wouldn't notice the difference. Also, Moustache may be brighter, with less of a noticeable dark patchouli in the base, but not by much. Projection is good and longevity is superb. I actually put Moustache on my arm yesterday and I can still smell it lightly on my arm 24 hours later. The patchouli in Moustache seems negligent at first, but it comes out and has some presence after about 10 or 12 hours, which is fine with me. \n\r\nOverall rating, 8.7/10, just a smidgen lower than what I gave Tuxedo, and if I were to take price into account it could certainly be a 9. Sample this if you can, though I also recommend it highly as a blind buy. Moustache is now available in the U.S. all over eBay, and at a few select online discounters. ",

It also has a heavier, very dressed-up feel, which makes sense being compared to something called \u201cTuxedo\u201d.\n\r\nDeeper into the drydown, Moustache EdP can't keep up with the projection I get from Tuxedo but it still does just fine.

That was a perfume that insisted on wearing me and I gave up on it completely after sitting through its insistence for a few tries. Now here comes Opus XI \u2013 with marjoram instead of oregano, but with predictions of \u2018beast mode\u2019, big, butch leather, and little evolution. It\u2019s no wonder I\u2019ve had my sample in a drawer for months, looking at it from time to time and ultimately deciding to try something else instead.\r\nBut no more dithering \u2013 time to take the leap. \r\nAnd I\u2019m relieved to report that sometimes I can be a silly scaredy cat. Amouage somewhat spuriously claim that Opus XI \u2018illustrates the inimitable dynamics of Oud\u2019. Instead, what is on offer is a rather remarkable woody leather, lightly handled, invigoratingly fresh in feel (like a splice taken from the barbershop gene) with gorgeous clean smoke and a suggestion of the fragrant wood that that smoke arose from which slowly becomes more prominent as the wear progresses. It could have been a heavy, knuckle-dragging mess but is instead lively and bracing \u2013 a go-out-and-face-the-day kind of perfume with a diffuse but far from overbearing sillage. \r\nSlowly one\u2019s perception of it broadens and sweetish half-green-half-floral notes emerge in the mix and the wood behind the smoke becomes more evident \u2013 slightly peppery, but also with a smoothness that is the right side of dreamy. It has that pleasing quality of being both layered and simple at once and the blend seems like perfection itself. \r\nA few hours into the wear I was thinking: \u2018This is a remarkable, sophisticated, polished thing that may even win around those who don\u2019t care for ouds or leathers. I haven\u2019t felt so excited by an Amouage since Dia Man.\u2019\r\nBut then Opus XI truly settled and it underwent a contraction \u2013 it became denser, a much more standard smoky woody with most of the freshness gone, and correspondingly it sat closer to the skin.

			"content": "First off, the bottle is gorgeous, and would befit a scent costing 5 times as much.  It's really heavy, with an inch-thick glass bottom; pick this up by the cap and you could run the risk of losing a toe if you didn't snap the cap down fully.  I weighed it on my kitchen scale:  1.5 pounds.  All-metal sprayer mechanism, too.\n\r\nI'm wearing this today side-by-side with my vintage Moustache eau de cologne.  Note:  this is NOT the vintage EDT concentree version with the tall gold cap.  This is the old EDC with the hockey puck cap.\n\r\nI'm sure no one expected this new version to hold up well against the original, given the restrictions on oakmoss and civet.  I certainly didn't.  But I have to say, this new stuff is not bad at all, although of course it's very, very different from its precedessor.  \n\r\nOriginal Moustache comes straight out of the gate with a huge bergamot/lime citrus blast, and unusually with oakmoss and civet appearing right at the start and sticking around for the whole ride.  You hear a lot of complaints about \"mustiness\" in Moustache, and I think that smell is a variation on Roudnitska's signature \"rotten fruit\" accord -- but here the must is from lightly spoiled citrus rinds rather than peaches or melons.  Have you ever had an orange or lemon go spoiled while sitting out, and noticed the gray fuzz that develop on the rotten spot?  That's what the musty fruit in old Moustache smells like to me.  And I like it.  I also like the light note of pine that floats in and out of the whole scent.\n\r\nYou also hear people compare Moustache to Eau Sauvage, which I've never perceived, except for the basil notes.  And Moustache had loads more of the mammalian funk (civet again) than ES.   Moustache had some of that \"clean/dirty\" dichotomy that the French do so well.\n\r\nThe new stuff has, of course, been substantially neutered -- no civet, no spoiled fruit.  It does have evernia prunastri listed in its ingredients, and there's some oakmoss echo in the mid and base phases.  But primarily it's a clean, crisp citrus (mostly lime to my nose), with light-handed basil and tarragon.  No florals that I detect, though geraniol is listed.  It's dry, very pleasantly astringent, and not at all sweet -- unlke what I hear about its new EDP version sibling.   There's nothing groundbreaking here, but it's a classic and well-mannered scent that would be a fine purchase for anyone looking to add a summer citrus to their wardrobe.  And it would be an excellent scent for a young man just starting out in fragrances, especially with its very manly bottle.      \n\r\nIt could have been so much worse.  At the price, I'm pleasantly surprised.\n\r\nOh, and about longevity:  normal for citrus colognes.    I've had both on for about 4 hours, and the vintage cologne is long gone.  The new is at skin level, like I'd showered with a lime soap.  I sprayed some of the new stuff on my shirt at the same time, and it's still going strong.  Both are still clearly detectable on paper.\n\r\nMy original plan was to pass this on to the boyfriend after I tested it, but that's not going to happen now.  I'll be hanging onto this and using it as a citrus refresher this summer.  It's completely unisex.\n",

Kus Kus was created by owner, August Doussan.\n\r\nThis is a complex floral parfum, a medley of notes, all beautifully blended to give an over-all impression of a nosegay of spring flowers. It is subtle, fresh and slightly spicy. No notes are provided, so it is a guessing game, but I do detect muguet, rose, carnation, galbanum, lavender and vanilla. A potpourri of freshly cut flowers mixed with gentle spices.\n\r\nAs seemingly the first multi-floral parfum, it precedes Houbigant\u2019s Quelques Fleurs by 70 years. Kus Kus is a delightful find and a worthy addition to the boudoir of any lover of vintage florals.\n",

			"content": "Burning Ben is so, so good. You definitely need to love phenolic scents to like it, but as long as your fetish is smelling like beef jerky on a campfire, then Burning Ben will really do it for you. It runs along the same lines as Le Labo Patchouli 24 or Slumberhouse Jeke \u2013 basically big, billowing bombs of birch tar, cade, and lapsang souchong smeared over a sweet or boozy baseline. But it features an innovation so good-smelling and so damn right that I can\u2019t believe nobody\u2019s thought of before now: coffee! The burnt, aromatic \u2018fresh roast\u2019 coffee bean note lifted out of SM Caf\u00e9 and grafted right on top of the burning cade-birch heart of Burning Ben makes for a smoky, tarry coffee darkness that smells fantastic.\n\r\nAt first, as you might imagine, it\u2019s a bit too intense, like a billycan of coffee that\u2019s boiled over on a campfire and is now sizzling meanly on the embers beneath. The addition of the coffee gives the birch tar leather a more masculine bent, and for part of this ride, I feel like I\u2019m wearing my boyfriend\u2019s leather jacket, infused with his scent of aftershave, manly musk, and general \u2018maleness\u2019 \u2013 this I find sexy in a cross-dressing way, and for people who find Patchouli 24 not masculine or butch enough, well, voila Burning Ben.\n\r\nBut before all of these intensely burnt, roasted flavors can run over into harsh or bitter, an oriental-ish and sweetly nutty base arrives to soften the edges. The basenotes are vague and amorphous in a way that makes you think, \u2018Mmm, that smells good\u2019, but also leaves you at a loss to define any one particular note or accord that\u2019s making it so.\n\r\nThe best I can do is to say that it\u2019s more like a texture than a taste, like those firm salted toffees whose pleasure lies mainly in the chew. Salty-sweet amber, toffee, beeswax, crushed hazelnuts \u2013 a sensuous m\u00e9lange of silky, warm \u2018brown\u2019 flavors that are the perfect accompaniment to the sharper, smokier \u2018brown\u2019 notes of birch tar and coffee up top. Burning Ben is one of the Strangers Parfumerie scents that smells ever better the more it goes on \u2013 perhaps the forceful nature of phenolic scents in general is what ensures the richness doesn\u2019t attenuate as quickly. Anyway, I love this category of scents, so it follows that I love Burning Ben. Beyond my general bias, I think that Burning Ben manages to pull off a bit of innovation in a genre that I suspect is rather a self-limiting space.  ",

			"content": "I have a much lengthier, more detailed review of Side Effect on another website, but rather than copy and paste it here I thought I'd write a shorter, different review for Basenotes. \n\r\nI went out to dinner tonight to a nice restaurant and I wanted to wear something a little special, a little more elegant and warm than my typical daily wear choices which involve a lot of fresh citrus notes, mint, and clean woods--so I chose Side Effect. It was the perfect choice. \n\r\nSide Effect occupies the Tabac Rouge, Tobacco Vanille, Ambre Narguile, Herod dimension.  It's largely centered around cinnamon, tobacco, vanilla, and rum.  As a matter of fact, when I look up at the top of this page at its note pyramid, I see that those are the only notes that are listed in its pyramid. So it's a pretty simple fragrance. To break down by percentage, I'd say that it's 30% Cinnamon, 30% Rum, 20% tobacco, and 20% vanilla. My favorite note among these is the rum. Side Effect has an excellent rum note--it strikes the perfect balance between booze and spice and ends up smelling quite realistic as well. Its prominence in the composition is what sets it apart from the fragrances I mentioned previously, as none of them feature rum at all, let alone as one of the leading accords. The other notes are also very nice. The cinnamon has a good, piquant bite; the tobacco is smooth and fresh and resembles a quality pipe tobacco or perhaps even more, golden tobacco leaves rolled in a premium cigar; and the vanilla is smooth and creamy, like a dark vanilla ice cream, emerging later in the base and giving everything a nice, gourmand sort of finish. And of course everything works in harmony. \n\r\nThis is a time-tested and true combination of notes that always smells good together and it's no different here with Initio Side Effect. But what I like about Side Effect, and why it worked so well for me tonight when I went out to dinner, is its strength and how its projection is calibrated.  Side Effect is not a loud, strong fragrance. It's politely restrained, never shouting or interfering with things outside its space. At the same time, it has persistent, steady presence. I was able to smell the fragrance all throughout dinner, but it was never even slightly distracting or intrusive .In the cold night air walking to and from the restaurant, it caught the breeze and escorted us on our stroll, lending just enough of its scent to be charming and enjoyed.  And when I eventually came home, I didn't even want to take my sweater off because it smelled so good with the couple shots I sprayed under my shirt.  This is what I think you will either like about Side Effect, or dislike about it. In my opinion, Side Effect is an example of how this combination of notes should be presented--never too loud or overwhelming but always steady and present. Its restraint shows class, and reveals the elegance of the notes. Too loud and they feel cheap and obvious, a tacky gourmand thrill meant to impress the novice; too soft and they're charm is lost, never to be fully enjoyed. Surely, some will find its restraint too subtle for their own tastes. They'll be looking for the wallop of Tobacco Vanille or the high intensity of Herod.  They won't find it here. Side Effect is a grown-up's gourmand and don't get me wrong--you'll definitely smell it and it definitely has solid presence--it just doesn't beat you over the head with it. The ingredients are top notch, without a scratchy or discordant note in sight, and its classic theme is sure to be enjoyed by many. And again, while the previously mentioned fragrance seem to mostly focus on tobacco in combination with some of the other notes, Side Effect has a unique rum accord playing a central role throughout which makes it somewhat unique. Final rating: 9/10, and a definite Thumbs up. ",

			"content": "Easy on those blind buys, fellas--the next Aventus this is not. I got my bottle in two days ago and have been able to wear it twice so far. It is surprisingly weak, tepid juice; a fruity concoction lead by watermelon that opens with a brief, juicy flash and then all but disappears in a matter of 10 minutes. The fruity accord which drives Bleu Satin (it's not \"Blue\" Satin) feels thin and shallow. The fragrance itself basically just consists of this accord and something that's supposed to approximate soft leather in the base, so overall it's a very simple and thin/weak fragrance which has almost zero complexity or depth. It doesn't project at all. I need to put my nose an inch up to my skin to smell anything 10 minutes after applying 5 sprays to my arm. I'm not joking, not exaggerating or using hyperbole...it is THAT weak. Let's put it this way: I put on 10 sprays 10 minutes ago and my wife cannot smell it on me. I asked her how she liked it and she said, \"What? I don't smell anything. I smell coffee.\" ( I had made a pot of coffee earlier.) \n\r\nAnyway, my only hope is that I'm experiencing a severe case of \"new bottle syndrome.\" I've noticed that a lot of times a fragrance will smell very weak when I spray it out of a brand new sealed bottle for the first couple of weeks. Then after a few weeks the juice really opens up and becomes stronger. I sincerely hope that's the case here because I really wanted to like this fragrance. I was very excited about it when I saw the note pyramid and realized it was being produced by Parfums MDCI, a house which traditionally is very good. I would love to be proven wrong and have to come back and eat my words, but I'm pessimistic about the possibility. Bleu Satin is just so weak and unimpressive it's hard to believe my bottle is capable of making some kind of drastic improvement over the next several weeks. \n\n\r\nSide Note: The only way I'm sort of enjoying this is buy pulling my undershirt up to my nose and smelling the fabric which I doused heavily in the scent. When I do that, it smells nice, but it involves shoving my shirt into my nose, having sprayed it about 6 times...and it's still a very light smell.\n\r\nEDIT/FINAL NOTE: This was NOT a case of new bottle syndrome. It is a weak, poorly performing, FLAT, and uninteresting fragrance. My \"new\" bottle quickly became \"no bottle\" as I sold this one off immediately after my fourth full wearing of the fragrance and realizing that nothing at all had changed. The only satisfaction I'm gettin from Bleu Satin is watching its little Fragrantica score plummet as more real reviews come in from people who have actually tried it.\n\r\n*one other thing: it is not remotely comparable to Aventus, unless you think anything with fruit is automatically similar to Aventus. The two smell nothing at all alike.\n\r\nUPDATE: 8/13/19:  Having had some time to step away from Bleu Satin, I can safely say, in retrospect, that this was easily the worst fragrance I've sampled in the last year. It is absolutely terrible, and its production is a shameful reflection of the direction MDCI has taken of late. Hopefully they get their shit together and never release anything like this again. ",

			"content": "There's something quite elegant in the simplicity of this one. Marketed as an aquatic version of Azzaro Chrome, I don't see too much similar between the two and it's a little annoying it shares a name and bottle design with Chrome, because the Aqua is much better. \n\r\nChrome Aqua is a fruity-fresh soapy aquatic from beginning to end. While apple is considered a heart note, I find it holds hands with grapefruit and aquatic notes on the top, and never fully decays, the pleasant top sticking around for the life of it. If Chrome Aqua is heavily synthetic it is very good at hiding it. The fruits and herbal notes in Aqua stays nice and cool, never warming up. Most aquatics try to be \"Aquatic Plus\", starting out with a refreshing clean smell but trying to do something complex with it underneath to very mixed results. God forbid you smell clean and fresh the whole way through without some kind of \"signature profile.\" \n\r\nIt's perfect as a daily fume in the hot summer, or for times when you're in close contact with strangers and don't want to offend. A couple squirts on the arm has decent projection, but if others do smell it the worse they will think is that you use too much soap, as it doesn't smell a ton like standard cologne. For conventions and gatherings where body odor is a problem, it can be quite the sniff of fresh air. There's nothing cloying or headache-inducing about it. It's what it says on the bottle, and it does what it does with surprising effectiveness. \n\r\nThe bottle shares its uninspired design with Chrome, the two can even be mixed up due to their similarity. Aqua's glass is frosted with \"Aqua\" lazily printed on it. The original Chrome bottle was designed 23 years before this one was released, and somehow the Aqua looks older, but maybe 80s nostalgia is the point here, and the straightforward design matches the juice to an extent. Still, those looking for a nice aquatic at a department store will spot this one from the shoe section, and it'll be just what they are looking for. A hearty recommendation. ",

Initial impression was that it was a Tobacco Vanille clone and has absolutely zero DNA relation to the original pink juice. On the face of it, there are many similarities to TV but scratch the surface and you'll find this is a different beast. In some ways, a subtler one but with just the right amount of savagery. The opening is loud: black pepper, cinnamon, hint of rubber but it proceeds to drydown at a speed I've not seen before. And the drydown is glorious. It's sandalwood but that amazing sandalwood oil that Body Shop produced back in the mid eighties. A sexy woody iso e super masterclass with a hint of soapiness and possibly camphor underpinned by a lingering vanilla tonka bean warmth that envelopes you like a favourite cashmere sweater. Longevity for a supposed EDP is piss poor but for an EDT it's good but not exceptional. Have a dozen blasts will see you good for about 6-8 hours. This stuff is exceptional. One of the best releases of recent years and possibly the best Joop since Nightflight and the original. This is a perfect winter fragrance and in a sea of smell-alike perfumes, this is an important release as it shows that there can still be new ideas out there. That might be overstating it but at the very least it's a new car travelling a well worn road. I suspect this will fly under many frag head's radar as the innate snobbery will refuse to acknowledge something of this quality can be produced by such a mainstream house but the proof is under your noses.

			"content": "Thierry Mugler Alien Man Fusion (2019) is bound to not be very popular among collectors and enthusiasts of the online fragrance community, which seems par for the course considering that the original Alien Man (2018) wasn't either. I feel that Thierry Mugler may be unintentionally targeting a non-existent market at this point with his masculine high street releases outside the A*Men (1996) range, since so far it seems like they shoot for this theoretical demographic of males who want high-concept artistry in their perfume choices without the clout and perceived \"ingredients quality\" of a high-priced niche brand. That's to say, they want a fragrance with obvious aromachemical usage warts-and-all like everyone's favorite mass-appeal scents in this price range, but without the actual mass-appeal to conceal it. To be fair, I liked the original Alien Man so I'm not saying this to be mean, but it must be said nonetheless. In the name of being against the grain, Alien Man Fusion presents itself as challenging just as the original Alien Man was, if not more so in many ways. Rather than just being a mostly-sweet composition with one glaringly out-of-place note like Alien Man with its dill, Alien Man Fusion comes across like a house mix of melodies from Alien Man, A*Men, and the original Angel (1992) with a controversial heart. \n\r\nThe opening of Alien Man Fusion is really sharp, a bit powdery, spicy, and difficult to love. Dual perfumers Fanny Bal and Dominique Ropion toss in helonial from Angel to achieve that sharpness, while cinnamon and ginger bring a bit of fire to it all. If this doesn't sound all that great it's because it isn't, but things change rather quickly as a sweet apricot-like osmanthus note comes into the heart, forming the bulk of the scent's character. I am not a lover of osmanthus by default, and it's abuse as the fruity floral go-to note for perfumes marketed to women doesn't help things, but I begrudgingly respect it turning up in a masculine. The osmanthus connects slightly to Hugo Boss The Scent (2015) and its use of \"maninka fruit\", which isn't my vibe either, but it joins the original Alien Man's cashmeran and leather. The base sees another drastic shift in tone as Alien Man Fusion turns into a skin scent. Coffee from A*Men makes an appearance, drying out and taming the osmanthus heart, while a typical scratchy norlimbanol \"beach wood\" note holds it down. All told, this is definitely not like anything else in the designer segment, and totally won't peg you as a \"bro\" if you wear it, but may cause some stares too. Performance is average all around, and that is something I can be thankful for considering the style, but having a lingering scratchiness on skin also isn't great either.\n\r\nWhere would I recommend using this? Well, if I actually enjoyed smelling it, I'd say Alien Man Fusion might make a good fall evening or romantic fragrance, at least more than the original, but I'd not be the one wanting to smell more than a few trails of this in passing so I'm a bad person to ask. I don't hate Alien Man Fusion, and can muster indifference about it due to the creativity and daring that went into it, but I don't find it particularly enjoyable. At best, Alien Man Fusion succeeds at being pleasant and is the furthest thing from linear since it does shift in tonality several times from start to end, but it just feels contrarian and edgy for the sake of it. Perhaps I'm missing the point and this has been the mission statement of Thierry Mugler all along, because we are talking about the same designer who has had some of the most bizarre fashion collections in the history of the modern world, but maybe I had grown used to past creations being at least a modicum of wearable. If you're looking for high art without a high price tag and don't mind that a chemist can pick out everything in your perfume with a sniff, shoot for a bottle of Alien Man Fusion, otherwise I'd stare at this like the trainwreck it is before slowly moving on.

Playing it safe is one thing, releasing absolutely derivative and just plain bad fragrances is totally another. Explorer by Montblanc is a sad addition to an already stale genre and it makes me mad on so many levels.\n\r\nLet's not beat around the bush, this is Montblanc's attempt at cashing in on the Aventus hype train, 9 years too late, a copy that nobody in their right mind asked for, a work so depressing and bad that it boggles the mind it exists. Three (!!!) perfumers made this, of which two have at least churned out passable, (albeit not classical) original (albeit not groundbreaking) fragrances in their careers. \n\r\nBe not fooled by the fragrance notes, there is nothing so sophisticated in the bottle (even the bottle is derivative). It's a smoky, citrusy pineapple from top to tragic bottom, absolutely linear in its progression. Vile, cloying and persistent, this chemical (in the worst possible way) broth refuses to go away once sprayed. I literally tried to wash my hands, Lady Macbeth style, and it lingered like the Mark of Cain. How in the world is it possible to use a budget like this, with a brief that probably sounded like \"Aventus, but cheaper\" and spawn this unholy mess?\n\r\nI've bought tree-shaped car fresheners that smell more lush than this. I've smelled bathroom cleaning solutions that weren't as aggressive to my nose. From a fragrance perspective, it's the equivalent of money so inflation-ridden, that it's not worth the time spent picking it up if one drops it to the floor. \n\r\nAnd naturally, since it's a clone of a sprayable meme, since it's persistent as hell, vulgar and impossible to ignore, it will probably sell like crazy. If this is what the future smells, I'm starting to regret the present, which says a lot.\n\r\nNote: This review is based on two full wears of this perfume, one directly in the store, and one at home from a sample I got at the same occasion.

			"content": "Explorer's a nice fragrance and so far, since I've been wearing it, it's been received well, with several enthusiastic compliments. I'm not going to go too much into its similarity to Aventus, for the simple fact that there may be quite a few people out there unfamiliar with the Creed that inspired this fragrance. After all, the average shopper looking for a fragrance tends to stick to department stores and shops in the mall, many of which don't carry expensive niche fragrances. \n\r\nAnyway, Explorer is a fresh, clean masculine fougere which blends fruity top notes with darker woods and sweet, velvety ambroxan. It begins with a bright accord built around bergamot, which immediately gives it a fresh, punchy opening. It doesn't smell like any one fruit in particular, though it bares some citrusy qualities albeit nothing sharp or sour. It's sort of a fresh, sweet bergamot and it's good start to things. Shortly after that the more masculine elements emerge, as an aromatic woods accord mixes with bergamot, bringing out notes of pine, and a grayer, almost-smoky birch. The woods are very clean and brisk, and they do a nice job of giving Explorer a decidedly masculine edge without sacrificing any of the clean, uplifting qualities that it's also established. Moving along, about an hour or so into its development, Explorer takes on the sweet, velvety characteristics of ambroxan, as it's no doubt used heavily here, though skillfully as well, as it never feels harsh or scratchy. In fact it's a very nice use of ambroxan, a nice presentation of the aroma chemical which gives the woods some sweetness, along with a plush, cushy sheen that wears in a smooth, soft, comfortable manner. Finally, it sweetens up even more as vanilla appears in the base. It's a reserved vanilla, never overtaking the fragrance itself but instead blending with the woods and ambroxan in the heart. \n\r\nProjection is good for the first 4 or 5 hours, and then it gets close to the skin but still leaves a decent trail in the air. Overall longevity is about 8 to 10 hours. Explorer can be worn casually or formally, as it's comfortable but also clean and to a degree, crisp. It's easy to reach for and versatile as far as situations go, so in that sense it could be one that's good to own, as you can get plenty of use out of it. Though I've smelled a few scents that remind me of Explorer before, I can't help but like it in the end. Worth sampling, and I can see it becoming a popular designer fragrance that gets a lot of sales at the local mall. Final rating, 8.5/10.",

When I heard they tried to ape Aventus I was intrigued, and tried not to let my pre-baked bias against the brand affect my judgement when I first gave it a sniff, which includes pretending like Aventus doesn't exist and this is a completely original scent. So I got 50ml and decided to test it out on people around me. \n\r\nThis is quite masculine and mature, and I have to give it some credit for not trying too hard on the opening, the bergamot is pleasant and doesn't decay too badly on the dry down. The mids are quite leathery, but it really starts to break down in the base layer, which other, more expensive hypothetical similar fragrances might not. And unlike that purely hypothetical fragrance, Explorer doesn't trigger headaches in those sensitive to smells in my own testing, something that is important to those who have those people in their lives. \n\r\nIt doesn't last terribly long and doesn't project a bunch. If it were more headache-inducing it might deserve a lower rating, but as it is I'll give it a thumbs-up. It's a good fragrance for those looking for a more subtle, masculine fragrance. The fact that it seems to be more neutral-smelling and doesn't have some of the more common migraine-inducing notes in my experience is enough for me to recommend it. ",

			"content": "Alright everyone, gather 'round, because we have ourselves here quite the little piece of work. Hype about Montblanc Explorer (2019) was already building a year before anyone even knew what the scent smelled like, but most of the post-release hype came from the online cabal I affectionately call \"The Kult of Aventus\". For those not in the fragrance community, this is a very vocal minority group of super-obsessive \"cologne guys\" that place a scent called Aventus (2010) from the luxury brand Creed on such a high pedestal as to almost be worshiped like a God, endlessly slaving over batches of the slightest variance year to year (it's a Creed thing), then literally stalking or harassing anyone who doesn't agree with them that Creed Aventus is the greatest male perfume ever created, and those who wear it the greatest of men to walk the Earth. It's scary psycho babble for sure, and this same group also crucifies any scent release that bears even the slightest of resemblance to Aventus with endless trolling, and the hype they've stirred around Montblanc Explorer concerns it being a designer attempt at a clone of their beloved Aventus. Now, there indeed are many out-and-out clones of Creed Aventus from a lot of fly-by-night imposter houses, and some of them are pretty damned close to be sure, while others are laughably cheap and vague to the point of being a parody rather than a true imitation, but the jury is hung here on whether or not Explorer is direct designer plagiarism of the niche realm. For the record, I can totally understand why the Aventus faithful would get the impression this is a clone, because for the first 30 minutes or so of the wear, Montblanc Explorer does bear more than a passing resemblance to Creed Aventus in it's evolution on skin, but it is more of a lighter, sharper \"sport scent\" sort of resemblance than a direct proxy. There is an alarming number of synthetics in Explorer as well, many of them being patented Givaudan captives that literally spell out \"this scent is only possible by working through Givaudan\", letting those savvy about the industry know who is really pulling the strings here, and that is probably the biggest black mark against Explorer, more so than any degree of claimed Aventus bootlegging. \n\r\nMontblanc Explorer opens up with a Givaudan Orpur\u00ae vacuum distillation of bergamot that strikes very close to another fragrance also lambasted by \"The Kult of Aventus\" as a clone: Mancera Cedrat Boise (2011). While I maintain that the Mancera has more in common with the later Dior Sauvage (2015), it does have juicy blackcurrant tied to bergamot like Aventus, while Explorer in this case does not. Instead, there is something fruity paired with the bergamot, but it is synthetic and much drier than the pineapple or blackcurrant from Creed, being combined with sage and pink pepper in a way that makes Explorer feel spicier than everything above. Once the heart moves in, Explorer does start focusing into a hazy facsimile of the Aventus accord, and it achieves that by using a similar denatured patchouli as Aventus and switching the birch smoke of that scent with the vetiver smoke of another Givaudan Orpur\u00ae, being their variety of Haitian vetiver absolute. The vetiver smoke here does a good job with the bergamot and processed patchouli, giving an \"Aventus Sport\" kind of feeling, with a lighter, less fruity, and more athletic take on the Creed. If Explorer had stayed like this, I'd be completely elated at having a makeshift sport flanker to Aventus as sometimes the vanilla and musk of that scent can be a bit much in extreme heat, but alas it is was not to be. Instead, Explorer does the usual 2010's designer trick of having glorious top and heart notes devolve into aromachemical sludge once we go into the dry down, meaning nobody will think you're wearing Aventus if they catch you after you've had this on a while. Explorer is frighteningly loaded down with ambroxan, called \"Ambrofix\" as it is again a Givaudan variant, and isn't your usual nuclear ambroxan like that in Y Eau de Toilette (2017), so Explorer avoids the \"ambroxan bomb\" tag. However, for as convincing an ambergris note as \"Ambrofix\" is, there's so much of it here with both norlimbanol and the naturally-derived but chemically-produced Givaudan \"Akigalawood\", that we're left with a drydown which could be mistaken for any number of 2010's \"crowd-pleasing\" designers when passing it on a department store counter. On the plus side, there really aren't any other designers on the market with an opening and heart this good, so you'd have to go back up to something like Aventus, Cedrat Boise, or even a vintage chypre to find bergamot of this quality before IFRA restricted its use, so there is some magic going on here. \n\r\nWear time is good but sillage is tight, as this is a typical eau de parfum, giving all-day performance for the average Joe who doesn't know who Creed are or what Aventus is, making Montblanc Explorer a solid and inoffensive office fragrance that is far better than the crud a host of others have passed onto the public in this style. With three perfumers put on task for Explorer, I would've expected more, but like with 2000's Calvin Klein scents, the old \"too many hands spoil the pot\" adage applies here. That being said, Antoine Maisondieu, Olivier Pescheux, and Jordi Fernandez have done solid work. If they didn't mean to clone Aventus, and I think bigger issues than irate online fanatics foaming over their keyboards would arise if they did, it is evident that there was at least inspiration from Aventus, if not direct orders from the top to make something \"in the vein\" on a budget for the economy of scale a big operation like Montblanc needs. What does that make Montblanc Explorer exactly? Perhaps it's payback for Creed making their own take on Montblanc Individuel (2003) and stealing its thunder with Creed Original Santal (2005), or maybe it's the inevitable deconstruction of the Aventus \"ambergris\" for use on the mass-market, like Davidoff Cool Water (1988) was to Creed Green Irish Tweed (1985)? Whatever Explorer is, I label it a \"me too\" scent, which is one semantic breath away from being a clone anyway. Sample as always, but if you're familiar with Aventus and came upon this stuff from reading a blurb about Explorer being \"a designer clone\", or maybe have sniffed a ton of bergamot-led ambroxan scents in a genre done to death and are looking for something novel, there is nothing here that will blow your mind and you may want to skip onto the next one. Conversely speaking, if you're looking for something fresh, versatile, compliment-getting, non-cloying, and don't care about synthetic mumbo jumbo or who's copying who, Explorer might just be the best masculine designer dumb-reach since Bleu de Chanel (2010) started this whole genre. Explorer is honestly the kind of thing Montblanc needed in their lineup if they expect to hang with the \"big boys\" in this arena like Chanel, Dior, and YSL, so there's that to consider as well.

			"content": "The \"Gentle Fluidity\" concept by Maison Francis Kurkdjian is rather novel: take the same ingredients and adjust the levels to create two separate perfumes of a pair, but leave them without gender designation so people can decide for themselves which is which. For my part the concept works, and while I have difficulty pegging which one should be masculine or feminine, I do find the Gentle Fluidity [Gold Edition] (2019) to be the warmer and more sensual of the pair, in addition to being louder as well. Gentle Fludity [Silver Edition] (2019) comes across as the more office-oriented or casual of the two, without as much sweetness, and no lingering sense of romance or sentimentality in the sillage like with the gold iteration. I suppose one could stretch this to say the gold one is more feminine because of its more emotional nature, while the silver one is more \"down to business\" and therefore masculine, but we run the risk of falling into close-minded gender stereotypes with this mindset. Fans of the Maison Francis Kurkdjian house might also notice a distinct lack of plush white florals and citrus notes that tend to run through most MFK creations, although the penchant for synthetic futurism and seamless blending is still present, meaning this won't feel unlike a typical MFK perfume, but of a different ilk from the usual fare from the house.\n\r\nThe opening of Gentle Fluidity [Gold Edition] hits you in the face right away with sweet vanilla, coriander, and musk ambrette. The juniper in this instance acts more like a top note than part of the core fragrance like it does with the silver counterpart, and doesn't have that gin-like sharpness, but it is always present. If the silver version reminds one of another take on the Creed Aventus (2019) phenomenon, this gold iteration reminds me most of the \"clubber DNA\" found in Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008), but obviously upscaled into niche levels of refinement. There is no juicy blood orange here nor a load of foghorn aromachemicals to make this scream feet from the wearer, but Gentle Fluidity [Gold Edition] does convey the same attention-wanting playful romanticism of a club fragrance, the \"come hither\" eyes condensed into a perfume. The mid section of the perfume is where the nutmeg lives, and continues into a drier and warmer spice trail as the base of ambroxan and norlimbanol create the \"ambery woods\" note listed by the house. This is shockingly simple for a gourmand/oriental type of synthetic perfume, and fans of MFK Grand Soir (2016) or the ever-popular Baccarat Rouge 540 (2014) would appreciate the familiar territory covered here. Wear time is over 8 hours and sillage is intense, but don't expect the projection one might get from a scent in this style, as Gentle Fluidity is as the name describes it and not a \"beastmode\" kind of experience.\n\r\nI recommend this for evening use, cold weather, formal, and romantic situations as hinted at earlier, while the silver component if owned covers the other bases of casual, office, and daytime use in warmer weather. \"Gentle Fluidity\" as a line may ruffle some feathers of older Maison Francis Kurkdjian fans who got their start on earlier releases like those from the APOM, Lumi\u00e8re Noire and Aqua Universalis lines, which still had clear-cut his/her releases or unisex fragrances that weren't split into variants for guessing games, but the future is now and I applaud MFK for turning the \"traditional pair\" on its side. I mean, let's be honest here; the idea of his/her versions of the same fragrance is a concept only made popular since the 1980's when houses like Calvin Klein went back and made \"for him\" versions of their popular standouts like Obsession (1985) and Eternity (1988), and that was a mind-blower back then because masculines usually stood apart with unique names. If anything, MFK is just taking the work of CK further, as evidenced by their reliance on forward-thinking synthetic compositions, but I digress. Fans of sweet ambrette and vanilla accords with the budget to handle MFK should seek this out, everyone else should otherwise sit this out, for the long and short of it is that Gentle Fluidity [Gold Edition] is a sweet slow dance kind of perfume regardless of who wears it. I enjoy this, but I also prefer the silver edition to it, so I'd start there if sweetness isn't your kind of vibe. Thumbs up. ",

			"content": "I sampled Maison Francis Kurkdjian Gentle Fluidity Silver yesterday and now I\u2019m sampling Gentle Fluidity Gold today.  The background is that both fragrances are composed using the same notes but in different arrangements\u2014a humbling reminder of the power of chemistry and perfumery.\n\r\nWhile Silver is a semi-fresh, sharp, herbal, and somewhat metallic perfume that strikes me as a men\u2019s signature scent, Gold is very sweet, more or less a gourmand fragrance dominated by vanilla.  It has a sugary, light, fluffy quality to, almost along the lines of a marshmallow texture but without the marshmallow smell itself.  There are hints of white musks, nutmeg, and woods, but in Gold, the juniper and coriander are far in the background, practically undetectable to my nose after hours of wearing.\n\r\nSome compare it to Montale Intense Caf\u00e9 without its coffee, but I don\u2019t even get much rose in Gold, so for me it remains primarily a vanilla-dominant scent, which isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s too one-dimensional or boring, though, as it has some nuance but the spiciness of Silver (from the coriander and juniper) is virtually nonexistent in Gold, at least on my skin.  It has a sort of dustiness, a dryness to it, as well, that prevents it from being an over-the-top gourmand, so that crafty restraint makes it more viable for more people than just gourmand lovers, I\u2019d say.\n\r\nIn summary, Gentle Fluidity Gold is a very nice vanilla scent: it\u2019s easy to wear, a reasonable performer, and even with my improved view on Silver, I still prefer it to Silver.  However, at its retail pricing ($225 for a standard 70ml MFK bottle in the US), it\u2019s a far cry from an easy sell.  And I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just uninteresting and safe enough to be good but not great, in my opinion, especially considering its pricing and the abundance of vanillas on the market, including scores of modestly-priced options.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "After falling in love with Narciso, I\u2019m exploring the rest of the line. Most are very pleasing except for the two original Narciso Rodriguez fragrances, which never worked for me.\n\r\nTheir lines of flankers make sense, sort of what flankers should really be about, though I find the names confusing and wish they weren\u2019t so muddied. There\u2019s a similarity in the flankers of course - though I like them, I have a bit of difficulty separating them. But I won\u2019t complain further, as a plethora of riches shouldn\u2019t be discouraged.\n\r\n\u2018Pure Musc for Her\u2019 is beautifully done. And it has a difference on my skin from the rest, being quite cool and centered on greener white florals. The note pyramid from another site also lists Woodland Lily (Muguet), Lilac, White florals, Almond and Powder, which feels right. I don\u2019t care for white floral fragrances, so I\u2019m sort of left wondering how this one managed to draw me in.\n\r\nExcept I love the balance in it, like marveling at a high-wire act, which it is for me. A mis-step in a white floral/green fragrance puts me right in perfume hell. So there\u2019s a built-in tension I feel which adds to my interest.\n\r\n It has a smooth, clean soapy musk note that manages to feel cushiony and soft. Combined with the green florals, it has a rightness I\u2019ve just never felt with others that try this. I like this fragrance, but also admire it. It has a smooth cool floral abstracted bouquet, abstraction being a quality I like more and more in fragrances. It may be one reason this works for me - it\u2019s blended, almost seamless, in the manner of Narciso Rodriguez fragrances, not about the notes.\n\r\nThis has a refined cool elegance, but isn\u2019t an ice queen, because of that perennially appealing NR sensual musk, which does wonders for a cool white floral. It presents the sensual beating heart I search for beneath the exterior of frigid white florals and frigid little muguet. Yet the musk is not behind or beneath. It\u2019s blended, like friends. So it comes across as sort of gracious, sort of restrained, sort of sensual, sort of romantic, and in all that self-possessed. I like this one quite a bit.",

			"content": "A soft, warm aromatic juniper fragrance with a sweet pine-sap aroma and some spiciness via (most notably) nutmeg. Juniper has that sweet, fresh-piney green sap smell and here it\u2019s the main accord driving the fragrance. If you\u2019ve ever smelled the sugary sap note in CH Men or Bentley Momentum Intense, they\u2019re a good reference point to get a handle on the dominating smell in Gentle Fluidity Silver, though the fragrances themselves are different enough so as to not require any further comparison. Fluidity has a smooth, blended, modern feel and stays close to the skin. It\u2019s clean without relying on any white florals, musks, or lavender, and it\u2019s one of MFK\u2019s most easy, laid-back releases. At the same time, simultaneous releases (in this case Gentle Fluidity Gold and GF Silver) can often leave both feeling a little unfinished and incomplete. I can\u2019t help but find myself wishing there was a little more here, something to make me raise my eyebrows or something to really sink my teeth into. It\u2019s a nice enough fragrance (it\u2019s very pleasant) but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unfair when I say that something is lacking. And it could just be performance. Silver is indeed gentle fluid, projecting no further than six inches off the skin and lasting about 5 hours. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who typically complains about projection and longevity either, but I\u2019d be doing you all a disservice if I didn\u2019t mention Gentle Fluidity\u2019s lackluster performance here. And while in some ways I enjoy a reserved scent, this one feels like it wouldn\u2019t hurt to crank it up a couple notches and maybe add another dimension to it in terms of complexity. Final rating, 7/10\n\r\nI'm giving this one a neutral, just short of a thumbs up. But it really feels like something is missing here, and without it, I can't give it a thumbs up. \n\r\nSide note: Kurkdjian\u2019s taken a departure here from his usual use of opulent floral notes and super-clean white musks, orange blossoms, and neroli. This is a fragrance that finally feels relaxed\u2014still clean and composed\u2014but completely at ease. It\u2019s a smooth wear and it\u2019s soft on the senses as well. Also, the aromatic warmth is good here, it adds to the relaxed nature of the fragrance and makes it even more comfortable to wear. Put Gentle Fluidity next to Amyris Homme in terms of its laid-back feel and simple, but enjoyable smell.",

			"content": "The \"Gentle Fluidity\" concept by Maison Francis Kurkdjian is rather novel: take the same ingredients and adjust the levels to create two separate perfumes of a pair, but leave them without gender designation so people can decide for themselves which is which. For my part the concept works, and while I have difficulty pegging which one should be masculine or feminine, I do find Gentle Fluidity [Silver Edition] (2019) to be the more office-safe, casual, and warm weather-friendly of the two. Gentle Fluidity [Gold Edition] (2019) is far warmer, sweeter, and much better for romantic evenings, formal use, or cold weather. There are no sharp edges, no herbal bitterness, no stoic professionalism on display with the gold iteration like there is with the silver version, meaning the gold version doesn't feel \"masculine\" in the traditional sense like the silver, and therefore might be pegged feminine by some. Of course, following this interpretation sort of goes against the point of expanding mental horizons with the intentionally-undefined line itself, but such as it is with people needing hard-cut gender boundaries in their fragrance selections, and no interpretation is really a wrong one anyway. Additionally, the Gentle Fluidity line itself is not your usual MFK fare, and doesn't rely on white florals or evident citrus notes to really push off like you might expect, but it does contain the same filigreed blending and synthetic sheen that Francis Kurkdjian favors. \n\r\nThe opening of Gentle Fluidity [Silver Edition] is very sharp and almost harsh. You have powerful juniper presented in almost a gin-like way with dusty nutmeg backing it up, smelling like a bottle of Bombay Sapphire at first before taking on a softer glow with a heart of coriander and ambroxan. Once Gentle Fluidity [Silver Edition] settles, it enters a groove similar to Creed Aventus (2010) or Montblanc Explorer (2019), but without all the fruity sweetness of the former or sage of the latter. Without any real discernible citrus note, this may be the driest take on the mega-popular masculine accord yet, with musk ambrette, vanilla, and norlimbanol creating the \"ambery woods\" effect of the base. There is less vanilla here than in Aventus, but the musk ambrette adds a bit more body in a different sense, even if the display of norlimbanol is scratchier than either Aventus or Explorer. The real star of the show here is that \"gin accord\" created by the juniper surrounded by whatever synthetics are in the top, so fans of that kind of smell should love Gentle Fluidity [Silver Edition]. Wear time is about 8 hours, and sillage is strong even if projection is not into the stratosphere, which is par for the course. People looking for a clean generalist will be bound to like the silver version of this over the gold, and I'm a gin fan so this ranks slightly higher in my book, although that isn't to say this scent is particularly boozy either, at least not according to what I consider boozy. There is no noticeable alcohol/cocktail vibe past the initial five minutes. \n\r\nPeople who love Roja Parfums Elysium Pour Homme Cologne (2017) but wish it had more juniper in place of all the usual Roja Dove complexity will find this to be a better and slightly-cheaper alternative, even  if neither of them are anything close to being a bargain. Naturally, having any similarity at all to Creed Aventus is an automatic cause for alarm among the sycophant armies that worship the scent as their personal liquid messiah and scrutinize every batch like they're looking for the Golden Ratio in every drop., but if you can ignore that highly-vocal and irrational minority of the fragrance community, you should find Gentle Fluidity [Silver Edition] to be just the kind of \"everyday clean and mass-appealing\" scent that Maison Francis Kurkdjian needed. Sure, the various colognes and Aqua lines could all arguably be called generalist and clean too, but they're too specific with their presentation of neroli or other citrus facets to be universal in appeal, plus don't have the versatility they need to deliver what this does. Gentle Fluidity [Silver Edition] is not your usual MFK, but also more familiar than you think, and very clever on the part of Francis Kurkdjian. Of course, people who need \"for him\" or \"for her\" won't find either Gentle Fluidity release very clever, but there are enough other MFK releases to satisfy them. Thumbs up. ",

It starts out borderline unappealing, very much the sharp and metallic side, but dries down into a more pleasant, harmonious blend.  Its pungent, almost heady, spicy vibes come from a healthy dose of juniper, but also coriander as supporting act, and an assortment of nutmeg, woods, musks, and vanilla.  But really, the juniper (first) and the coriander (second,) are the standouts.\n\r\nThe very opening can be a bit much but overall, Gentle Fluidity Silver is a nice, year-round-friendly, versatile offering and it actually might be more noteworthy than Gold for that reason, despite Gold being a bit easier for me to love.  Silver performs pretty well, being of reasonable density for hours and having good longevity.  The retail of $225 for 70ml in the US is about on par with what I\u2019ve come to expect from MFK but it\u2019s still a lot to ask if you don\u2019t love it.\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019ve become a fan despite finding it a little tricky on paper to start.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "A gorgeous and enveloping citrus.  Cool and fresh notes dominate from top to base, though the overall effect is to wrap you in you in a warm buzz that (in my experience) lasts much longer than other complaints would lead you to believe.\n\r\nTrue, this is not a projector.  Still, at 48% oil concentration, I'm not convinced that volatility and launch of all of these essences was what the perfumers had in mind.  Instead, this is a scent that you wear for yourself and the one lucky enough to get close to you.  It's clean and green (or yellow... as bright lemon is the strongest of the citrus accord), freshened by mint and the sweetness of black currant.  Unlike so many colognes, top notes do not disappear quickly to leave whatever base was deemed necessary to give the perfume weight.  I think that's what I most appreciate in Aenotus; it's a citrus that retains its citrus throughout while holding its balance over the musks and oakmoss.\n\r\nAenotus is a shapeshifter, but not in a linear fashion.   Again... the top doesn't fade and the bitter moss, petitgrain, or sparkling patchouli never take over.  Instead, you get a carousel of the same notes that feel progressively closer and more distant (then closer again) as the scent spins on your skin.  \n\r\nAnother exceptional (errrr... 'master' ?) perfume from Puredistance and one quite unique to the line of traditionally dense and heavy sillage monsters.  It's the freshest and most uplifting (yes, I'm even looking at you, \"white\") of the range.  Safe in a crowd, long lasting (I do suggest you aim for the clothes and one spritz to the hair), exceptionally beautiful, and completely unisex.  \n",

			"content": "Rusak\u2019s portrait of the Southern California desert starts at ground-level and moves upward. The frankincense, which Rusak tinctured himself, permeates the perfume from start to finish. Combined with labdanum and other resinous materials the frankincense smells dusty rather than woody or sappy. It\u2019s rooted in an earthy accord that smells more of sand and stone than moist garden soil. The sense of scorched desert is palpable to the nose. Rusak says that the dry-soil effect is in large part due to a tincture of smoked, dried peppers that he created in his studio. The result is a sun-baked coziness that\u2019s much more personal than the geosmin overdose sometimes used to give fragrances an earthy but often brittle vibe.\n\r\nTo a large extent the smell of the SoCal desert is the scent of fire. The remnants of past brush fires seem to linger for years in the charred stumps of juniper and scrub oak. Papery sagebrush and dried pi\u00f1on pine needles provide fragrant kindling for the loose fields of waxy, smoky creosote bushes that make the desert smell as if it could burst into flames at any moment. Io balances smokiness and dryness to reproduce the moody tension of desert air on a hot day, where the combination of bone-dry plants and burnt remnants are the before and after of a seemingly inevitable fire.\n\r\nThe challenge of an incense perfume is the momentum of the frankincense itself. Placing it at the center of a perfume can make the perfume simply follow the dynamics of the material, no matter how hard the perfumer might try to steer it in other directions. Rusak bends frankincense to his own purposes just as he twists the expected geography of the material. Frankincense\u2019s origins are in Eastern Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula where the boswellia sacra tree grows. Perfumer Chris Rusak transplants his tree to the desert of Southern California where it reinvents itself in classic Californian fashion",

Unfortunately, this fresh, aromatic lemon's fate also mirrors that succulent ripe lemon in Eau du Citron Noir: quickly tainted by acrid, screechy woody amber aromachemicals. Here, they're not as smoky as in Eau du Citron Noir, but mainly to provide a dry, almost dessicated texture to a salty, slightly mineral note, in order to imitate the ambient aroma of sea water in canals and stone walls in Venice.\n\r\nAlthough I do detect the delicious, jasmine tea-like redolence of pitosporum on the test strip, on my skin, the floral notes in La Lagune remain frustratingly vague throughout the whole development. Once the fresh lemon note completely disappears after about 2 hours, Un Jardin sur La Lagune then remains this abstract, slightly salty floral musk with an unpleasantly fuzzy undertone of woody amber aromachemicals. The later eventually take over after 5 hours and turn La Lagune into an amorphous woody amber musk, not unlike the far dry down of many current masculine perfumes centred around these popular woody amber aromachemicals.\n\r\nUn Jardin sur La Lagune has a moderate sillage on me and is pretty tenacious thanks to its woody amber musk dry down, lasting almost 11 hours on my skin.\n\r\nAlthough I can more or less see why these elements are chosen to recreate the imagery of hidden garden behind stone walls with wafts of sea water through the canals, the abstract combined effect doesn't smell convincing to me. I guess this rather atmospheric treatment aims to be coherent with the rest of Les Jardins series, but the problem for me is that, while those scorching woody amber aromachemicals and inorganic-feeling mineral notes can work magic when they're cleverly disguised within other notes or when they're surrounded by vivid details, they often appear very artificial to me when they're laid out bare or without enough intricate details to smooth out the edge, which is more or less what I perceive in Un Jardin sur La Lagune. Because of the noticeable presence of woody amber aromachemicals and a resulting more harsh texture, I'd recommend it to those who enjoy Eau du Citron Noir and are interested in a slightly marine twist, rather than those who enjoy the previous entries of Les Jardins series.",

Not exactly the same scent but does have some similarity. Lavender florals emerged in the heart that blends with the existing galbanum. I do pick up on a violet leaf note that is present in GIT. I definitely pick up a dominating fougere here. A few hours in the florals started to taper off while the oakmoss and wood notes started to creep in. Some of the magic from the fougere effect is lost but is replaced with the mossy accord that we're used to seeing that is present in some of the other rogue scents. Decent longevity and silage. I must say It carries a timeless feel similar to GIT that it could fit in with the modern times. Overall I would consider this a gentlemen like scent, formal, classy, and clean. If one enjoys the smell of Creed Green Irish Tweed, one will likely enjoy Fougere L'Aube. Great work Manny!",

Added to this complicated combination of flowers, the cucumber comes across to me more like lily, but with a plasticky freesia quality as well.  The whole thing shimmers like gold, but also maintains a deep green sensation of pollen.\n\r\nThe closest comparison I can make is Malle's En Passant, but though this contains the same basic ingredients, it's mixed differently, coming across more bright and shiny and simultaneously less synthetic (less plasticky than Malle's lilac) and also less realistic (than Malle's thick acacia base).\n\r\nVery wearable (more so than En Passant to me), but weird and interesting enough to keep me entertained.

			"content": "Opening notes are just cheerful perfection to me. I feel sparkling citruses (probably lemon or bergamot?) and some herbs, it feels very cheery, sunny and summery, slightly sweet, but not too sweet. But then it goes to the absolute soapfest of a soapiest rose I have ever witnessed (okay, haven't tried that much!), and I DO NOT like it at all. If I want to smell like soap, I use soap. The problem is, I never want to smell like soap, so I'd rather conceal the soap smell under some other fragrance or use gel instead. After a couple of hours, fortunately, the soap is gone and the drydown is beautifully green and a bit herbal. Overall it's a very pleasant and subtle fragrance that gives off a vibe of summer fields and sunshine. I do recommend it, especially if you like cheery green herbals and some soap.\n\r\nHoney wasn't prominent to my nose, the sparkling citrus, various greens/herbs and rosy soap was. Though it does give some subtle sweetness to the scent. If you want prominent honey, L'Occitane's Terre De  Lumi\u00e8re is the way to go. The scent leans slightly more feminine to my nose, but feels very suitable to be unisex scent if green, soapy and cheerful is your thing.\n\r\nI didn't like it enough to buy a bottle because I dislike soapy fragrances (I'm still considering a mini or a small gift set though, because the top notes are simply gorgeous and drydown is really nice), but if I was given one, I would gladly use it as a fresh and cheerful spring/summer daytime scent. \n\r\nOverall, this seems like quite a safe buy as a gift for a loved one - it is as suitable for a teenager as for a senior, especially if they want some bright summery cheerfulness in their life (and it's hard to find someone who doesn't). And the bottle is really lovely.",

			"content": "What if somebody made an updated version of Diptyque L'Ombre dans L'Eau (1983) without the focus on rose in the finish? Well, L'Occitane seemingly wanted to answer that question with Herbae (2019), and a rather fine answer it is. Fans of 21st century fresh green fragrances like Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori (2018), Cristalle Eau Verte (2002), Calvin Klein Truth for Men (2002), Ninf\u00e9o Mio by Annick Goutal (2009), or Chanel Cristalle Eau Verte (2009) will likely want to take note of this, as will fans of older style galbanum-lead chypres from the 80's on back. Granted, this isn't a bitter oakmoss extravaganza like the icy aloof chypres of the 70's, but the same botanical spirit is there, softened with some modern citric sweetness, white florals, and musk. Herbae is nothing if not crisp, and perfectly unisex, like most things in this category new or old, and represents another excellent launch from the mall boutique niche label, after Terre de Lumi\u00e8re (2017) and Verveine Agrumes (2015). I find this stuff has the \"clean white shirt\" effect on me, where so many masculine perfumes that claim to have such an effect utterly fail as they beleaguer me with heavy synthetic woody amber bases or shrill chemical freshness.  \n\r\nThe opening from this is quite something, and you get a lot of galbanum, bergamot and pink pepper right away, giving me a bit of an 80's chypre flashback. The scent soon settles into some nettle and musk mallow, which recalls a bit of that 70's feel I mentioned, but Herbae becomes soft-spoken and \"modern\" in the way it handles the florals thereafter. A lightly sweet rose water and blackberry jam tandem emerge to meet the staunch green citric opening, and merge with clary sage and the nettle to make this a bit closer to feminine by the time the top fades, although the base of cashmeran, tonka, Haitian vetiver, and a smidge of oakmoss make this gender neutral once again. A honey note creeps up late in the game, and also adds to the pleasant affable nature of Herbae, coming across less like an exercise in herbs like the name suggest (there are no herbs here), and more like a visualization of a grassy field pocked with white nettle flowers. Wear time is surprisingly long, although sillage is mild. I'd say this could become a summer favorite for some, and a scent that a couple (of any orientation) could easily share on a weekend outing to a park, the countryside, or even just a nice dinner enjoyed outdoors like on a patio or deck.\n\r\nMy only gripe comes from the bottle and it's sprayer, one being a bit slipper in hand due to shape, and the other being one of those slow-to-push types like Dior Sauvage (2015) uses, giving forth a whole ton of juice if you decide to press it all the way down. I guess L'Occitane really wants you to roll in the stuff when you wear Herbae, but a little bit of manual dexterity and restraint can mitigate most of those concerns. Like most L'Occitane perfumes, this smells incredibly artful and punches well above it's price point, with credit to Nad\u00e8ge Le Garlantezec (who composed Terre de Lumi\u00e8re) and Shyamala Maisondieu (married to fellow perfumer Antoine Maisondieu) for maintaining that reputation for the house. Granted, this doesn't have the luxurious density of upper-tier niche nor the exotic ingredients the snobs and hipster crave, but it just smells damned good for costing so little. Lastly, the cute little raffia and clear top just make Herbae feel a lot more classic than it might otherwise be, and looks great on a dresser instead of stuffed away in a larger collection of perfumes. Smell for yourself of course, because some people are very picky on how \"green\" fragrances are executed, but I for one think this is a good compromise between nature and nurture. Another little gem of a scent from working-class perfumers L'Occitane! Thumbs up! ",

			"content": "07738 is another interesting limited-edition offering from Bogue, presumably exclusively via Luckyscent of Los Angeles, now wholly sold out on its website.\n\r\nIts rather lengthy note list creates, for me, a rather resinous yellow floral creation, consisting of a few floral players that have a balance of freshness, sharpness, and sweetness: ylang ylang, tuberose, and jasmine.  The other main piece is a mix of resins, perhaps labdanum, most prominently, that foster a sort of creamy vibe in concert with the aforementioned florals.  Lastly, some woods seem to complement the other items and bring it all together. Overall, it's not a terribly sweet or spicy mix, but rather a creamy floral with aspects of powder and freshness.\n\r\nThe main attribute that needs mentioning is the strength of the juice, however.  It's unusually strong for its extended of opening of a couple of hours, during which the sharpness and florality of the blend overshadow the creamy, resinous, and sweet qualities of it.\n\r\nWith extrait concentration and a bottle cost of $245 for 50ml, though, I wouldn't expect much less than a strong fragrance, but even so, the stuff is very strong, so there's good value there.  Overall, though, it's a bit too sharp for too long for my liking, and it misses the mark slightly while being interesting and complex.\n\r\n6 out of 10",

			"content": "The Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013) \"DNA\" has more or less run rampant through modern masculine designers in the 2010's decade much in the same way Bleu de Chanel (2010) and Creed Aventus (2010) have. This particular variant of the \"ambroxan bomb\" is sweeter and thicker than the rest, inspiring a host of clones that either replace the fresh citrus top of Invictus with more oriental notes like Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo (2016), or toss in a slew of mega-sweet cloying shower gel notes like Spice Bomb Night Vision (2019), to create the sillage monster to end all sillage monsters. It seems with the latest Invictus flanker, Invictus Legend (2019), Paco Rabanne seeks to basically parody itself, using the same over-the-top sweetness most copycats have utilized in their attempt to \"out-Invictus\" the original Invictus itself. While of course much more wearable than many of these other flunkies, Invictus Legend really brings nothing new to the table, and is just a tired, achy rehash of things that feels like Paco Rabanne is making a new release just for sales persons to say they have something new when asked about the brand. Is that what we've come to? I guess so. It's no wonder so many serious fragrance enthusiasts have given up on designers, since the glory days of Azzaro Pour Homme (1978) and Drakkar Noir (1982) have been replaced with the malaise of Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu (2018) and Paco Rabanne Invictus Legend.\n\r\nThe opening is rather good and very reminiscent of the original Invictus, with the sweet mandarin and grapefruit marine accord returning. This time around, the sweetness is a little higher, and pungent aldehydes help push the scent along like an old-school bottle of Aramis (1964), which seems like a good thing at first, but only at first. There is a metallic geranium and bay laurel vibe in the heart to thicken this up, joined with a somewhat annoying fruity cascalone and galoxide smell that instantly takes your mind to a cheap bottle of Sauve for Men body wash, or something sold under a private label by your local grocer chain. This is where the Invictus DNA morphs into a monster, as the base stuffed to the brim with ambrox, honey, cardamom, and synthetic woods posing as \"guaiac wood\" take over, much more heavily-handed than in the original Invictus, making this smell like a bottle of men's shower gel come to life and battering down your door for attention. Invictus Legend teeters between pleasant and unpleasant in the dry down for this reason, as the original Invictus vibe does battle with this new base, but ultimately loses. Wear time is a good eight hours and sillage is \"beast mode\" just like the bros want it. I'd use this as a night club scent, as that's where I feel this vibe works best, and it's much too sweet for any kind of warm weather appeal, despite the otherwise citric personality of the composition. Domitile Berlier joins Nicholas Beaulieu, the latter of whom worked on the new version of Invictus Aqua (2018), but they just don't seem to \"get it\" with this flanker. \n\r\nI'm not super surprised at this stage in the development of mainstream masculines about the Invictus accord being abused this way, as Paco Rabanne has a track record of beating their pillars to death before moving on, and still releases flankers for Paco Rabanne XS Pour Homme (1993) and Paco Rabanne One Million (2008) to this day. The last of these flankers usually end up being the worst, especially if the pillar wasn't too artistically significant to begin with, and you can look to the last of a long line of half-baked Ultraviolet Man (2001) flankers to see what I mean. Granted, Paco Rabanne is a great house for men, and scents like the original Paco Rabanne Pour Homme (1973) will always be legends among connoisseurs, but in between all their noteworthy pillars, you'll get cash-grab fodder like Invictus Legend, that's just the way they've always done things, outside the commercially-doomed one-offs like T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 (1988). I don't totally hate the stuff, and if I caught this on someone's collar, I wouldn't cry foul, so I won't totally flunk out Invictus Legend, but as it stands, I can't endorse it either. Test for yourself because everyone sees things differently, but the best I can give this rather unnecessary and almost cynical flanker is a neutral rating for not being a total disaster. Another middling flanker that will one day command big money on the aftermarket when cancelled, just like the original Invictus Aqua (2016). Sniff at your own risk!! ",

			"content": "For starters, let it be known that Dolce & Gabbana are self-parody in the men's segment, issuing flanker after inane flanker of lines all over a decade old, taking such a tired and fiscally-safe line of brand rehash that they likely need to be put out of their own misery like Old Yeller if not for the respect commanded by the old pillars upon which all these flankers are based. It also needs to be mentioned that Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Pour Homme (2007) is the one pillar amongst the legacy lineup that I don't much care for, so I went into this flanker review expecting another forgettable release like Light Blue Pour Homme Italian Zest (2018). Much to my utter shock, Light Blue Pour Homme Sun (2019) isn't just better than Italian Zest, but better than the original Light Blue, actually squeaking by as a worthwhile freshie for the summer months. There's a lot of Light Blue Pour Homme DNA in this \"Sun\" variant, but the primary difference is a focus away from dry/crisp/boring oceanic accords and a new center of gravity based around a beachy theme bolstered by coconut, osmanthus, ozone, and ginger. I don't know who penned this, but I doubt it would be another phoned-in Alberto Morillas composition like the original.\n\r\nThere are only a few small tweaks here but they are enough to turn something I'd never wear into something I'd consider buying, because the kind of semi-earthy and semi-fruity beach vibe here is something the aquatic genre hasn't seen since the glory days of the genre between the late 80's and early 2000's with stuff like Aramis New West (1989), Calvin Klein Escape for Men (1993), and Jil Sander Sun Men (2002). The Light Blue Pour Homme opening is intact, with aquatic notes and dry citrus, but bolstered with sweeter grapefruit and a sharp ozonic aldehyde. The heart is where the real magic lives, as calone merges with osmanthus and coconut to make that sun tan lotion smell which really recalls summer trips to the ocean, with rosemary and dry woods segueing into the standard Light Blue Pour Homme base. This base isn't entirely untampered, as ginger and vanilla warm and mildly sweeten the musk, oakmoss, cedar, and vetiver carrying over from the original. startlingly complex for an aquatic, and much warmer with more development, Light Blue Pour Homme Sun just feels like a more complete version of the original. Wear time is a decent eight hours, and despite the vacation vibes, this flanker is warm enough for spring and early fall use too, but best in casual settings.\n\r\nHonestly, it's the coconut and osmanthus that really make this a cut above most aquatics and even the original Light Blue, as those notes rarely appear in any masculine, but when they do, offer a gender-blurring versatility and olfactive \"happiness\" that's hard not to like. Osmanthus in particular is hard to pull off in a masculine context, because its apricot-like aroma is so ingrained with feminine fruity florals that it usually triggers those associations in CISHET guys familiar with their wife's or girlfriend's wardrobe. I'd almost say this should replace the original Light Blue Pour Homme as the new pillar standard, as it does more for the aquatic genre than anything has since Bvlgari Aqva Amari (2014), which is another uncommonly warm and unique (also read: misunderstood) aquatic that offers more than it appears to be at face value. Thumbs up to Dolce & Gabbana for doing something creative again, even if it is in a likely-limited flanker form. Sampling this may be difficult, as most stores I've found do not have testers of it, and just box stock, but if you can get a whiff of Light Blue Pour Homme Sun, you won't be sorry. ",

			"content": "SPHINX \u2013 Kenneth Jay Lane\n\r\nThis precursor to the heretofore thought unique Angel, is impressive (as was Angel) as a fruity floral with a solid and intriguing base.\n\r\nLane is little known in the perfume world, having created just two scents, and his Sphinx predates Angel by a quarter of a century. Lane\u2019s career was as costume jeweler to a celebrity clientele, involving Jacqueline Kennedy, Audrey Hepburn and Brittany Spears, often commissioned to recreate favorite pieces for wearing in public, while the original remained safe in the home vault.\n\r\nComparing the note trees of Sphinx and Angel, they seem to have only three notes in common, Patchouli, Sandalwood and Vanilla. Yet the similarities in the top and heart notes are unmistakable to the nose. Sphinx is not as loud, not as over the top outrageous, as Angel, with a more subdued quality, a subtlety, round, sweet and unctuous, yet the overall effect as a distinctive fruity floral is that of being identical, one to the other.\n\r\nQuite hard to find, though still available on line, usually discounted, this seems to be on its way to oblivion. It is worth finding, however, if only for the distinctive bottle design, that of a sarcophagus, with a gold sculptured Pharoah\u2019s head.\n\r\nTop notes: Bergamot, Yuzu, Peach, Lychee\r\nHeart notes: Coriander, Pepper, Clove, Rose, Jasmine, Peony, Lotus\r\nBase notes: Vanilla, Cedar, Musk, Patchouli, Sandalwood\n",

			"content": "I owned this fragrance previously and eventually swapped it. It is most assuredly a rich, complex perfume with high quality ingredients. The oud, resins, patchouli, lavender, vetiver, and spices (cardamom and black pepper) are the most prominent notes to my nose. The Fragrantica pyramid is actually missing a few notes - notably pear, iris, amber, and olibanum. The combination of the pear, iris, oud, sandalwood, and resins create an extremely smooth and creamy texture which I absolutely loved, though the pear and florals weren't really all that detectable. The oud in this fragrance is fantastic - a woody variety without any barnyard stink. There's something very soapy here - maybe the cardamom - that makes this fresh, versatile, and suitable for all seasons, despite the otherwise \"heavy\" notes. The combination of it all together, somewhat surprisingly, makes it smell like an extremely high quality blue fragrance crossed with a barbershop/gentlemanly classic (lavender + patchouli) with a little bit of oriental inflection. It really is a beautiful fragrance - a mix of old and new, West and East.\n\r\nSo why did I swap it? Two reasons. The first is this - on my skin, it simply didn't perform very well. After trying it in both cold and warm weather, I got maybe 4-5 before it entered skin scent territory. Overall longevity was around 6 hours, with poor projection and sillage. This could simply be a consequence of my own chemistry - my skin eats fragrance - but Zaharoff himself remarked to me in a Youtube comment that the high concentration of naturals in the blend could reduce performance. You'll have to try it for yourself to see what you get it out it. The second reason was that this was simply a bit mature for my tastes. I think it could easily be a beautiful \"signature\" (heh) scent for men 30+, but for me (24), I felt like it simply wasn't the best fit. Make no mistake, there is definitely a throwback retro vibe here. If that's your thing, then this will absolutely be the fragrance for you. It's not really my thing, so I had to swap this for something that I felt was a little bit more \"me\".\n\r\nOverall, though, this is a beautiful, well composed fragrance that is a strong showing for this brand. It's absolutely worth a try if you like classic, gentlemanly fragrances that have a little bit of a modern flair. It wasn't for me, but it could be for you!",

			"content": "This perfume is a genuine masterpiece, unfortunately for myself and I\u2019m actually very surprised, I can\u2019t get down with this. It is strong, it is heavy, it has massive sillage and lasting power and is an oud dominant perfume which is why this is so friggin\u2019 strong. Outside of the genuine agarwood oil there\u2019s a ton of patchouli in this which further increases the throw.\n\r\nThe entire composition is \u2018incredibly\u2019 heavy and dark. On a 1-10 scale of masculinity, this is a 10. Way too much for my personal tastes. It\u2019s a very intrusive perfume and it\u2019s just really heavy and dark and dank, wet like and soapy, it\u2019s strange. I like it but then I don\u2019t, it\u2019s hard to explain so for that alone this perfume gets a 100%. It kinda confuses my nose because I\u2019m not sure how it makes me feel, kind of disturbed but then a calming effect, really very strange but cool.\n\r\nThe real agarwood oil used here is legit and is one of the main focal notes outside of sandalwood. It is an unabashedly woody and masculine perfume. The sillage is very strong in it\u2019s delivery in the sense that what you\u2019ll be smelling is really very dark woods and a lot of patchouli. I\u2019m having a hard time dissecting this one. \n\r\nI can appreciate this. There was a boat load of thought and skill poured into this and as mentioned before, zero synthetics so Kudos to Mr. George. I just don\u2019t enjoy this smell at all, it kind of makes me feel a tad nauseated and I\u2019m not sure what accords are making me feel like this but I think it\u2019s the sandalwood/oud combo. I\u2019ve worn this at home numerous times and it\u2019s the same result, nausea. I can\u2019t express enough how heavy this scent is.\n\r\nBy the way, I have smelled and worn Indonesian agarwood oil before and it\u2019s really dry, rooty like, kinda swampy and earthy but no barnyard as if the oud oil had been distilled from the roots of the tree, more like white oud. This perfume has a ton of genuine oud oil in this which is the main focal point, possibly even the first voted note so ignore that voter scent pyramid entirely, it\u2019s not even close. I really dislike Australian sandalwood, it kinda makes me gag, I think that\u2019s the culprit here. Regardless, excellent scent so if this jives with you, it\u2019s a gem. It\u2019s a really strong eau de parfum that lasts easily 18+ hours. I wish I liked this smell because it\u2019s honestly a really well composed creation that wafts sporadically. It\u2019s very beautiful in it\u2019s sillage, stinks up close. My God it\u2019s just so friggin\u2019 heavy and overpowering.\n\r\nYou wanna know what the performance and overall delivery of this perfume reminds me of? Not that it smells the same but, this is a glorified 80\u2019s perfume for Men reincarnated to be modern. Rochas\u2019 Macassar which is an utter masterpiece that is far too complex and far too strong for its own good, just like Zaharoff.\n\r\nThis is an agarwood perfume through and through, it\u2019s all about oud oil, sandalwood and patchouli. Brutal perfume. I approve, just can\u2019t handle this, way too strong, fuck...",

			"content": "So this was a present from my kids on Christmas. I told them \"what do you want Dad to smell like everyday, if you could pick just 1.\" So Polo Blue Gold it was. I'm telling you what, this has been a very special surprise to me. I already enjoyed Blue EDP so I wasn't sure how this would differ but here is what I've loved. 1) Compared to the other EDP, this lasts all day on me. I mean really strong 2) I find the initial blast still has the Blue DNA but it is a little sharper/sweeter/fresher and just lightens my mood from the start and 3) the most enjoyable thing is the drydown, which is very \"delayed\" on me, like wearing another scent 5 hours later. The first 2 times I wore it I kept thinking...\"who is wearing that nice scent around me.\" It had the incense type feel of AdG Profumo with a twist. Maybe it was the Amber and Patchouli playing off the incense but it was great. I don't do many reviews but this was a winner on me and glad my kids went with this. I hope Polo keeps it around because I think it's their best release in a long time. ",

			"content": "Gentleman Cologne (2019) is a lighter and more-summery take on the Gentleman Givenchy (2017) phenomenon and is designed to compete alongside summer citrus colognes like Dior Homme Cologne (2014), Chanel Allure Homme Sport Cologne (2006) and L'Eau d'Issey pour Homme Fra\u00eeche by Issey Miyake (2016). This segment doesn't have much wiggle room for variation without going into full neroli traditional eau de cologne mode or branching into something else like an aquatic or ozonic, but Givenchy has done decently enough with Gentlemen Cologne to not fail at the given task, if that is all you need to hear when deciding on making a purchase. For me, there are a ton better citrus cologne options, many of them antique by modern mall fashion standards, although I can appreciate the attempt to liven the primary accord with more zest given the original Gentleman Givenchy was about as phoned-in of a trend-riding zombie juice as it gets. \n\r\nGentleman Cologne opens with lemon and lots of it: a very fresh and pleasant straightforward \"lemon shaved ice\" kind of tone which is very sharp but not unpleasantly so on the nose. Petitgrain and bergamot join the lemon and there you have the primary character of the scent. Most eau de colognes live in this moment and then are gone in 30 minutes, but since this still needs to have the full dry down as per most mall fragrances, the citrus gives way to rosemary and orris root, which soap things down a bit and keep them barbershop in feel until that ambroxide-fueled base appears. The ambroxan is dialed way down low and with Haitian vetiver replacing the woody tones it doesn' create that woody amber glow that most things in the category do, but a laundry musk note sweetens the finish. It's all pretty meh by this point and I can no longer tell that this was meant to be a fresh citrus cologne, but the opening was rather nice at least until the sloppily-assembled aromachemicals attacked.\n\r\nWear time is decent for an eau de toilette, which is what this really is, but the \"cologne\" aspects (the best part) are over after the first hour, replaced by a generic ambery sweet mall masculine accord that does extend the life of the wear but does so unnaturally, with no real transition from the top into the base. You're wearing a nice lemon Italian soda one minute, then a weaker version of Gentleman Givenchy the next, and that is where I find most fault in this. Had Gentlemen Cologne been a real cologne, and gone for the hour of glorious natural freshness, I would say bravo and give this a thumbs up, but as it stands, they just stapled eau de cologne top notes to a bargain bin clone version of their own pillar in the base, for another cynical cash grab that will likely cause more serious fragrance guys to give up on House Givenchy and slide upwards into the ever-inflating world of overpriced luxury niche brands, who will deliver the experience this could have delivered for four times the cash. Hard pass. ",

It lacks the fruity notes, providing for a fresher top of ginger and mandarin, drying down to a more generic base of patchouli, vetiver, woods, and musk.  It makes for a cleaner, less fruity version as it lacks the blackcurrant, green apple, and, of course, pineapple.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pleasant but in my estimation, somewhat unnecessary variation of what is already a fairly fresh and robust scent in the original Aventus, which, even though it\u2019s not a personal favorite of mine among the Creed freshies, is nonetheless an agreeable, versatile, well-done scent that merits most of its acclaim.  The Cologne feels a little superfluous; I don\u2019t personally pine for a fresher, more transparent alternative to Aventus.\n\r\nStill, at the right price, Aventus cologne is still superior to many Aventus clones, even with a little less gravitas than the original Aventus.  The retail pricing ($435 for 100ml) remains challenging for this and other recent Creed releases, so I\u2019d caution potential wearers to try and find a good deal if they do like, or just try the more widely-available and batch-variant original first.\n\r\nAventus Cologne is surely good but not great, in my opinion.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Aventus Cologne (2019) represents a startling number of firsts for the house of Creed. Creed originally had no interest in making flankers, because part of their marketing scheme was making every creation of theirs with a unique identity, implying that flankers were a way to transfer the brand cachet of one success over to another potentially inferior scent. Well if you know anything about Creed, it is that they believe their perfumes are superior to everyone else's in the market. They are the self-proclaimed oldest and most prestigious French perfume house in the world, and the only one still using a dynastic system long abandoned by the likes of Guerlain or Houbigant. Making flankers erodes that narrative, and places them in line with the designers they claim to be so far above, yet here we are with an Aventus (2010) flanker. Rewind to 2010, and the original Aventus proved to be a smash success, becoming the best-selling Creed perfume of all time, eclipsing other big hits like Mill\u00e9sime Imp\u00e9rial (1995) or even Green Irish Tweed (1985). They had little luck in the 2000's so they were overdue for another upper-class blockbuster to keep the interest of white collars and celebrities, so Aventus arrived just in time. The scent itself was uncommonly modern even for Creed, who usually balances old-world compositional values with modern aesthetics, and set a standard that trickled down to other niche houses, then the designer realm. Creed was boxed in by their own mega-success, and Aventus was dangerously close to being mainstream for a house that averages $400-$500 a bottle for their perfumes. Anything that came after would forever be compared to Aventus as a potential successor, meaning something like Viking (2017) was doomed to failure before it ever saw a single sniff from fans, so Creed had to continue using the Aventus name. There was no choice, Creed had created a monster, and that monster was owed an heir; Aventus Cologne was that heir. Now, Aventus for Her (2016) did come before this (setting another precedent), but we don't tend to think of the opposite sex portion of a matching pair as a flanker, since neither is intended to be worn by the same market as it's companion on the other side of the fence. With that logic in hand, this is indeed the first flanker the house has ever created, but that's just the first of several new precedents being set. \n\r\nThe second big precedent set by Aventus Cologne is the very style in which it exists. This is a thoroughly, undeniably conventional fresh fragrance, with absolutely zero link back to any of Creed's traditionalist DNA. Yes, there is the house ambergris note under it all (likely ambroxan with the volumes they produce these days), but the rest of the scent is very nondescript. Aventus made magic happen by having just a spark of that traditionalism mixed into what was otherwise a modern forward-thinking scent with mass appeal, but in Aventus Cologne, Creed just completely concedes to  the tastes of what they now know as the real audience of the original, and these aren't the kind of people that shop haute couture boutiques or want anything on the cutting edge. Simply put, Aventus Cologne is Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Pour Homme (1996) for the affluent. We get a familiar vacuum-distilled bergamot as with Aventus proper, blended with blackcurrant and pineapple, but an added crisp green apple and mint enters the fray, imparting something of a 90's aquatic vibe minus the actual aquatic aromachemical note. The heart has some jasmine hedione, lots of the stuff just like the erstwhile Armani, with birch listed but no discernible quantities to my nose being found. I do get the listed rose, and a neat soapy kind of a thing that reminds me of a fresh foug\u00e8re like Creed's own Himalaya (2002), but the base is all white musk and the house ambergris note with bits of oakmoss. The end result is a scent which draws parallels to Dior Homme Cologne (2014) but with a price tag many times higher, and a smidgen better performance. Light, spry, and fairly ubiquitous in tone, this is the first Creed that doesn't really \"smell like Creed\". That final touch of finesse which almost convinces you of the brand's pedigree isn't there, and you're left with another \"mall jus\" that blends in quick with the crowd. Wear time is long as with any Creed, but sillage is not monstrous like the original, meaning the \"cologne\" tag is mostly appropriate despite eau de parfum strength. This is rather casual for a Creed, although compared to the many designer \"eau de sport colognes\" on the market, Aventus Cologne feels like a cut above, but more so your average 2010's \"niche\" creation catering to a wealthier slice of the mainstream and not something in the aspirational range of a brand like Creed. Has Creed finally crossed the line with this? I don't know. Have they delivered a common, totally safe, run-of-the-mill fresh masculine that treads the same waters designers have sailed for the past thirty years? Most definitely. \n\r\nUltimately, Aventus Cologne is the flanker it sets out to be, a lighter and fresher take on Aventus that is easier to wear and better for summer. Funnily enough, Montblanc already beat them to that punch with Explorer (2019), a scent that strips the main accord in Aventus of its fanciness and presents a bergamot, vetiver, and ambroxan one-two punch that's leaner, meaner, and easier to wear in summer too. It got derided as a clone by the cult of tech bros who worship Creed Aventus in unhealthy amounts, but the successful democratization of the primary accord in Aventus was bound to happen, in the same sense that every mega-successful accord draws inspiration, going all the way back to the numerous takes on Chypre de Coty (1917). If Aventus Cologne had released at the height of Aventus madness maybe 5 years earlier, it would make more sense as a first-ever companion flanker to the best-selling behemoth, but releasing a year shy of the 10th anniversary tells a different tale, one of a house trying to extend the life of its cash cow after failing to make a successor that instead ended up becoming another entry in the extended range. This has \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" all over it, and for that reason, sets the third precedent of the house making a scent to directly appease the fanboys, which kills any suspension of disbelief that Creed is a noble perfume house with centuries of glamorous history who sets trends for everyone else. Pardon my intense cynicism. Do I like it? Of course I do. There is hardly anything unlikable outside the price, but all the designer options treading the same ground make it silly to buy this if you're not a die-hard Creed nut. Will the target market like it? I say mixed reactions leaning positive at best. If the only thing you wear is Aventus, with all other scents being inferior and only \"the King\" and it's batch variations being worthy of touching your skin, this is probably not for you. But, if you're the kind of guy who was pulled into the phenomenon by a YouTube video, fell in love with the stuff after snagging a decant, but wish you had a better warm-weather option from Creed that shared some DNA with Aventus instead of their usual dandy citrus florals, Creed is now speaking directly to you.

			"content": "Everything about the new Aventus variant is confusing and weird. It's called \"Aventus Cologne\", cologne being the colloquial term for men's fragrance, however this is marketed as unisex (more on that in a bit). It's not an Eau de Cologne, but an EdP like every other offering by Creed. I suppose they're using the original-original definition meaning perfumes in a particular style from Cologne, but not having smelled any perfumes from the 1700s I can't really speak to that. \n\r\nIt has the same design as Aventus save for a light gray instead of black theme, though in many ways the two fumes are very different. I'm somewhat convinced that this started out as a different concept (maybe a fragrance for teenagers? They did make something truly awful for babies the other day), and the genius marketers decided to make the new concept an Aventus flanker to help drive sales, along with a really stupid graffiti-themed advertising from the 90s. Shame too, because it's actually quite nice. \n\r\nI didn't like the original Aventus due to its fizzy fruit basket opening where it seems like pineapple overpowers everything. The Cologne's opening is only tangentially similar to that, it's much more of a fruity aquatic. Strangely, it reminds me of another fragrance (also a variant to a popular main entry that should have been its own thing) released in 2019, Azzaro Chrome Aqua. The Chrome Aqua was more soapy and a tad metallic, but the Aventus Cologne is more toned down and leans more into a ginger-mandarin. But where it separates itself entirely from other aquatics is in the mid and the base, a nice mix of wood with a touch of vetiver. It's quite nice, but...\n\r\nWell, performance becomes the big demerit for this guy. It doesn't project a bunch, and doesn't last too long. Longevity is not even in the same ballpark as Green Irish Tweed, which seems to last longer than an Irish folktale, and performs worse than Millesime Imperial, which is already more of a subtle fragrance. 4-5 hours and it's gone, not good for something to wear to work or school. There's also little that sticks out about it in a lineup of other aquatics, and someone has to be right up on you to appreciate the more complex layers. Overall, it's nice, surprisingly complex, but underwhelming, I'm left wishing it was half as bold as the marketing would suggest. \n\r\nOh, and it's not unisex as Creed claims- if it is then 80% of the whole men's fragrance aisle at Macy's is also unisex. It's more masculine than Millesime Imperial, which is just barely unisex. Creed already has a number of great unisex fragrances, I don't know why they feel the need to list everything as so. ",

			"content": "The youthful coral pink bottle of Fizzy Pink attracted my gaze instantly, the glass is colored from the inside and so does the transparent cap. It was sitting next to another beauty named Tempting Rose,  with an even more capturing bottle, which I will describe soon. I checked the notes on Zara official site and found that just three were mentioned: red berries, rose, and musk. Right of the bat, I was hesitant whether to test it or pass by. Red berries in fragrance aren't usually my thing at all! I tend to find them cloying or sharp. Instead, I bought this beauty immediately after trying it. It's just gorgeous!\n\r\nAt first, as you spray it, it has a citrusy inflection reminiscent of green tea with lemon, but red berries are prominent enough to make the tea illusion vanish. You definitely get the super pretty fruity berries, a burst of juicy, fresh, tart and sweet, sparkly red berries blended with a youthful rose which is very natural and not overpowering,  yet here they're light and pretty a sort of minimalist gourmand. The berries in Fizzy Pink remind me of crisp ros\u00e9 wine. A few raspberries mixed in, only lightly sugared, rosy-pink and sour-sweet. Even though it is not listed, I can also detect the slightest hint of something like a powdery note that allegedly comes from the orris root, which lasts throughout the heart and blends well with the floral rose. Thankfully, this berry opening is not very fruity and sets a beautiful stage for a sublime rose and iris chord to develop calmly. \n\r\nThe core of the fragrance is comprised of all sheer, transparent floral note, the rose is dewy and delicate, and the musk and possibly iris gentle the tart notes a bit. It's a rose yet it has a tartness that makes it more than just a straight up rose. I think that tart note, I suppose from the berries, makes it more interesting and unique. To me, these are not traditional red roses, they are more lady pink and white, subtle, building in beauty as if one were adding freshly cut roses to a vessel individually over a period of time, enjoying the intensity of them as more and more blooms fill the air with their scent. The faintest hint of iris adds a cosmetic touch to the composition, giving it a slightly retro feel.\n\r\nDry down is a musky rose, powdery and clean.in this stage I sometimes have an illusion of smelling a whisper of white florals in background. Not even a dose of musk that comes up later weighs down the fizzy, sparkling effect. The white musk that this fragrance contains is blessedly subdued by the roses and seems to act as a fixative, more of it would have rendered this fragrance unwearable to me. \n\r\nIt's not a complex or niche scent but it has that \"something\" that makes me like it. It's so beautiful, refreshing and uplifting. The berries are sparkling and tart, without sharpness or aggressive acidity. The rose is sheer and bright. The white musk is soft and creamy, betraying not a hint of laundry detergent. I expected it to be very light and faint, something I can just smell by pressing my nose to my skin but on me, it projects quite well! I can smell pretty wafts of this fresh rose-berry scent all around me at least for an hour. it takes two hours for it to calm down to an almost skin scent, this usually happens for me in less than an hour so I'm pleased with its projection not just because I can easily smell it. Spring is the right season for wearing this beauty, during a warm day, at the office as well as at home. This is another sumptuous fragrance from Zara, which worth it!",

At the same time, I'm critical of mint, and fragrances which use it poorly don't impress me, nor do I like them, so I think it's safe to say that the mint used in L'Homme Ideal Cool has been used well--otherwise I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I've been.\n\r\nTo begin, the darker, warmer and heavier elements of L'Homme Ideal have been toned down. While the pleasantly sweet, cherry-almond accord of the original is still very much present, it's as if the bass has been removed from it, and in turn what remains is something lighter, more airy, and much cooler. The original has significant portions of tonka and suede lending weight to the base and overall composition, but here they've been pretty much removed altogether. Ideal Cool sits well up in the air, floating around deftly with swift assurance. The original is more grounded, centered around the body and its immediate space. In place of the tonka and suede, there's a mild woody structure built around vetiver, with a slightly ozonic edge. It gives the fragrance a somewhat dry, unfettered impression which serves it well, providing a buoyant backbone for Cool's sweeter and more refreshing elements--mainly an airy, aromatic cherry-almond accord and a cool, natural spearmint which happens to straddle the perfect balance between sweet and herbal/natural. And it's mainly these two accords--the almond and mint--which comprise Cool's smell as you wear it (though you may pick up on some fragrant neroli as well). Because the cherry sweetness of the almond has been elevated, and its heavier supporting notes removed, it takes on a subtle, airy quality that diffuses well while remaining somewhat mercurial and never \"too much.\" The mint serves as an excellent compliment in this scenario, adding its refreshing touch to the almond and taking the fragrance to an even higher, cooler frequency. It blends with the cherry aroma of the almond and gives it an icy chill, sweet but diffused and ethereal. This is the latest flanker's greatest success--keeping the original's almond accord in tact but modifying it for a fragrance with \"cool\" in the name, adjusting certain elements while bringing others in to create an altogether new fragrance which is clearly and firmly connected to the original. Simply put--it got rid of everything it needed to and added all the right stuff in order to create a successful and true flanker. (\"Sport,\" for example, and on the other hand, veered too far off the path, leaving us with something ultimately removed from the original and nearly unidentifiable as part of the line). \n\r\nPerformance wise, Cool is just fine. 4 to 6 sprays should last you a solid 6 hours, in which it will steadily give off its pleasant, airy aroma to those within several feet or an \"arm's length.\" It catches the air nicely and has undeniable presence without ever becoming too heavy or intrusive. Cool has been serving me well as both a casual and office/work fragrance, and while I've worn it a few times at night, it really seems to shine during the daylight hours. Spring is the PERFECT season for it, though I imagine it will continue to work in the summer and early fall as well. Although Cool is not widely available in the States yet, rumor has it that Epcot Center is already hawking bottles and it shouldn't be too much longer before it's arrived on a larger, more accessible scale. In my opinion, it's worth the retail price, however if you're looking to save money, sure enough, a year from now, it should probably be available at the usual discounters. Anyway, thumbs up for this one and kudos to Thierry Wasser for making a really nice flanker to a line that could use a little boosting. Final rating: 8.5/10, possible 9 if it holds up over time.",

			"content": "Unexpectedly, my first-ever review for Basenotes will be for Replica Whispers in the Library (2019) by Martin Margiela. I say  \u201cunexpectedly\u201d as vanilla fragrances are often off my radar, or they are at most allowed to occupy a satellite relation found somewhere in the dry down of my preferred scents. At the same time, however, this is also interesting because as a teenager who once wished to find a desirable vanilla fragrance to somehow find a casual place alongside my testosterone-driven collection of everything-but-the-kitchen-sink mashups of the 1990s and early 2000s, in addition to my post-gym dialups of sporty hesperidiums, I was both overwhelmed and underwhelmed by the selections. Those selections were limited to my budget, so the then bridling take-off of niche houses didn\u2019t\r\nfit the bill. Eventually university found me in an environment (and a time) when fragrances were viewed with suspicion due to milquetoast social conventions, and quite honestly the cost of academia precluded me from new acquisitions amongst my newfound priorities. Funnily enough, despite limited resources I would experiment with a certain cheap and rather unremarkable vanilla oil from The Body Shop . . . thick, sweet, rich, unnuanced and somewhat directionless, not unlike my life\u2019s plan in those days.\n\r\nUpon examining the Maison Margiela collection at a local department store devoted to the house\u2019s complete set of Replica fragrances I was greeted by an excellent mediator. I arrived, prepared and generally well-read - as Jane Austen would describe, \u201ca man of information\u201d - and was delightfully surprised by the knowledgeable reception. Truth be known, this level of commitment feels rare to me and is something seriously lacking in the retail side of fragrance (lest you visit a somewhat a boutique as opposed to those teeming with a bazaar-esque slew of choices). Otherwise, those fragrance lovers on a more discerning journey normally take refuge in the quality found in the contributions at Basenotes and other online destinations that enhance the hobby. I must confess that I did not arrive bent on trying the subject of this review; rather I arrived with a predilection towards sampling By the Fireplace (2015), Jazz Club (2013), and At the Barber\u2019s (2014) due to the online buzz. Each of these are intriguing concoctions with a time and purpose, and I hope to sometime divulge more about them. I had initially zeroed in on At the Barber\u2019s as I am eternally striving to find that clean feel, whether it be a lavender-laden foug\u00e8re or a white laundry musk. Perhaps something even akin to one of my all-time favourites, Helmut Lang Eau de Cologne (2000 and 2014 reissue).\n\r\nBut what surprisingly captured me on that warm and sunny early Summer afternoon was Whispers in the Library (2019). Amongst the handwash-shaped capsules this one both surprised me and won me over as a sample to explore further.\n\r\nListen, I know there already exists an encyclopaedic stack of time-honoured and contemporary hip(ster)-to-the-moment vanilla fragrances found in both market squares and in quiet niche houses. Tobacco and/or amber and/or woody notes are readily laced through a plethora of vanilla inspirations that are already so encompassing that it can be intimidating to find your juice. I get that. But not unlike the old adage that searching for love often results in not finding it, so too is it true that being unmindful of love is often the condition wherein it finds you. This was certainly the case with my long-forgotten cause to have a suitable vanilla fragrance in my collection.\n\r\nSo how does Whispers in the Library make its case?\n\r\nNot a sludge vanilla confection. Not a glazed gourmand. Not a saccharine delight. Not an overt sexual impulse. Not a steamy moment where your inamorata\u2019s lips press to your neck at the discotheque. This one seems indifferent to those realms. On the olfactory side you won\u2019t find your Montale Vanilla Cake (2018) and eat it too. It exists indifferent to the cloying found in similar Thierry Mugler campaigns seemingly given to regal patisserie settings of Versailles sweets, their exteriors a glazed talisman forged by Bourban vanilla simmering with butter and sugar in the saucier . . . and, of course, the cigar that chases dessert. And on the experiential trajectory nor have you a JPG Le Male (1995) beasting for evening affection and traces of vanilla found on the post-coital bedsheets.\n\r\nIt goes on without a boozy opening customary to its kin. Or at least comparatively not so boozy. This is a clean, somewhat unsweetened vanilla suspended and kept aloft by a black pepper accord. From the inoffensive opening the pepper holds it in sway and seems to open the vanilla up to a drier, less malty residue form of itself. Indeed, the pepper lifts it and the cedarwood holds it in place. About 1-2 hours in there is something else I detect: Is there something almost floral far in the background? Or is this just one of the chemical properties of the cedar at this stage?\n\r\nThroughout the journey one is reminded that there is a coolness to this vanilla, or at least something surprisingly on the cool side of warm. In the middle stages the cedarwood enters stage right and begins its supporting role. The lead settles down into something quiet and dusty, with just a little vigour too. A powder softens from somewhere behind the curtain. This is where Whispers in the Library averts your attention to the proclaimed imagery. Vanilla, paper and waxed wood . . . there it is! Either I consciously fell for the \u201ctime and place\u201d aspect of the Replica line or there is an artistic accuracy at play.\n\r\nDespite its decidedly short list of ingredients this is not an entirely linear journey, for there is a soft transformation somewhere in this episode. And this is where there is a gentle complexity where one looks for it in this library. Where once this professorial, soft tweed jacket and v-neck sweater-bedecked gentleman was muted by his time-honoured laser focus on the livre at hand, now he appears like a young savant with a crisp white t-shirt and a fitted, soft, unstructured merino cardigan-style jacket, and a pair of dark rinse jeans and Jack Purcell\u2019s crossed over his knee. He continuously looks up and out the window, his eagerness, curiosity and ambition not quite yet conditioned. He casually yet elegantly exists between two worlds. The tone of this attraction is something sapiosexual.\n\r\nI cannot place a finger on it but the vanilla itself is of a premium quality. A different type of vanilla. One would assume this was the first ingredient selected in this minimalist recipe, the pepper tailored it and the woods supported the tasteful image of the bibliophile in the library. There is a notable discretion about this one, something modern yet conservative in a manner not often applied to vanilla fragrances.  There\u2019s nothing beasting here. One is held in a dry repose which deems its raison d\u2019etre an elevation of a meditative awareness. Although Serge Lutens Un Bois Vanille (2003) shares some similar perceptive characteristics (waxed, woody paper) I find this one to be more interesting. On a personal note if the Serge Lutens offering possessed a smoky note then it would have more of what I was looking for, I suppose(?) . . . but then it would shift away from its feminine side. And, in fairness, any smoke in Margiela\u2019s m\u00e9lange would strut in a different direction altogether.\n\r\nThe full experience came on a Sunday morning. My plan was to begin the day (how convenient!) by reading deeper and further into my Marcus Aurelius. Yet, with the inspiration behind Whispers in the Library in my mind, I allowed myself to feel carried away to the leather-encased stacks found in my favourite library/study pod at my old alma mater. I suppose this is as close as I would get to my \u201cancestral library,\u201d to take from the marketing spiel. I allowed the designer\u2019s aims for this fragrance to make me imagine the scenario further: Walking beneath the Tudor Revival tower above the entrance way, along the hall and down the steps into the nearly hidden library. There, with my cahier and books spread across a desk shared by generations before me, I succumb to the the quietude found in that boutique library. I pause and look up from my reading to gaze through the Jacobethan stone window onto the courtyard outside with covered perimeter walkways upheld by tiny columns, and the organ music wafting from the upstairs college chapel where talented students from the nearby conservatory would - albeit tastefully - play to their heart\u2019s delight so long as the old vestiges were not unsettled. I cherish the fact that my mind found this sacred memory, so I mentioned it here.\n\r\nMy day continued with a long walk along the bay with a steady wind coming onto the pathway across the water. Nothing was whisked away. I kept smelling Whispers on the Library wafting in and out throughout the day. I was surprised and delighted at its staying power, though the vanilla accord had sweetened somewhat without its players whose roles had rescinded during the latter dry down. The vanilla, like this point in my day, was less quiet about its starring role on this stage. Acquaintances who I met for coffee commented on it, one even politely requested to lean in closer to glean a more comprehensive experience. This one is appreciated.\n\r\nA tasteful, elegant little evocative experience. Easy to wear and none so brash. Sure, a wee bit sapiosexual . . . why not? \n\r\nAfter repeated events with it I can say that longevity is decent at 7-9 hours. Sillage is moderate and restrained, much like the bibliophile in your life, keeping to himself but quietly exuberant as he turns the pages.\n\n\n",

This latter notes sweetens a bit further, and leads us into the base where it morphs into a good lashing of a vanilla impression that increasingly strengthens its grip on the base notes.

			"content": "Giorgio Armani has gone down the dreaded \"flanker of a flanker\" route yet again with Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu Instinct (2019), which is a flanker of the mediocre Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu (2018), a scent that sought to cash in on the ambroxan craze of the 2010's. Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu wasn't horrible, but a super hum-drum flanker that was just too similar to Emporio Armani Stronger With You (2017) for its own good, and never really had a chance to shine. Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu Instinct seeks to make things more interesting by adding some stuff to \"dirty up\" the accord of the previous iteration, accomplishing this feat with some really abrasive synthetic woods that have appeared separately within tolerable levels in other designer or niche fragrances over the years, but are all together here. The result of this cocktail is a half-baked idea of a scent that didn't entirely suck as it was on its own turned into a total disaster of annoying proportions, making another \"industrial cleaner\" accord but of an even higher magnitude that I'm apt to avoid. This \"mixing of singularly strong aromachems into modern powerhouse fumes\" trend seems to be emerging to carry over from the 2010's method of just maxing out ambroxan and/or norlimbanol into yet another \"volume war\" in the 2020's, and if so, I intend to sit it out because this stuff literally makes me unable to breathe. I'm dead serious. I was only able to suffer this stuff long enough to get a review of it by taking periodic breaks and ultimately lean on my rescue inhaler. I've literally never had a fragrance give me that kind of a reaction in my life, not even the strongest powerhouses I own from the 80's.\n\r\nThere's trace DNA of the original Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Pour Homme (1996) in the opening of this monstrosity, with dihydromyrcenol and bergamot swaddled with a salty marine aspect and persimmon. The heart of denatured white patchouli and cardomom adds the modern mall take on oriental spice this seems to goes for, then the Ambroxan-powered base of the first Absolu comes in almost on cue. The total transition time between all this is less than 5 minutes by the way, so I'd say we have yet another linear wonder sauce, and before you know it, the synthetic woods attack with a fury I have never seen until this review. Similar to but even stronger than Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle \"Monsieur.\" (2016), or any host of Tom Ford ouds featuring a similar \"Comet cleanser\" scratchiness, a miasma of norlimbanol and \"ebony wood\" (also see: incense, sandalwood, and a few others this note gets labelled as by other houses) comes in like a wrecking ball to literally induce an asthma attack on the wearer (this happened to me). Akigalawood smooths things enough for me not to wretch, but it just adds to the volatile lung-upsetting stew of this odorous stank so it does little to save my impression of it. Wear time is overbearingly long and sillage is horrifically strong. The stuff is so tenacious that after I had finished sampling, I had to wash my arm, then wash it again, then wash the hands that washed it when I got home, and continue to wash them until they were parched from all the soap. I still had trace smells of the base under my fingernails afterward. If you dig this kind of kill-or-be-killed vibe in your signature scent, I suggest use in winter for casual occasions because this is just too brusk for civilized company.\n\r\nI don't really know \"what is up\" with this trend of jamming a base full of this caustic asphyxiating cocktail of \"wood\" notes, but it creates almost an instant scrubber to my nose especially when it dominates the composition in short order like it does here in Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu Instinct, then goes on to literally dominate your senses, your pulmonary system, then you. Inane flankers are one thing, and even more inane flankers of flankers are another, as it's just a hallmark of the accountant-driven mainstream perfume market these days, throwing out a ton of tries and discontinuing everything that doesn't stick, but this here suffocating little ditty isn't just offensive, but actually dangerous to the wrong person because of how sloppily thrown together and deliberately overcharged on aromachemicals it is. People think Dior Sauvage (2015) is toxic waste, but it is a pocket full of posies compared to the Godzilla-sized dose of Firmenich's finest chemical warfare found here in this ghastly creation. I don't think it's possible for me to more emphatically give this disapproval than I am here now. This stuff is more than bad, it's literally better used as a self-defense weapon a la a can of pepper spray than as a fragrance worn for enjoyment. Trust me on this, I don't often speak in hyperbole unless the situation truly warrants it, and this is one such situation. Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu Instinct is downright noxious waste passed off as a designer fragrance. My first \"instinct\" was to escape it ASAP. Test this one at your own risk. I'm not joking.

Much better than Absolu, this is what Absolu should have been as it smells more like Acqua Di Gio, And is like Profumo with Woody notes instead of the incense, while keeping the fresh signature Acqua Di Gio opening that can be found in the Original, Essenza, and Profumo (I find Absolu to be much sweeter to the point where it isn\u2019t clear that it\u2019s an AdG flanker, and I think Absolu should have been the flanker to this).  \n\r\nAfter you spray it and as it dries down you can smell the woody notes slowly appear as if the Woods were submerged in the aquatic opening, and you get the slight touch of amber and ebony woods and patchouli fills in the scent creating a very comforting yet freshly invigorating scent.  The woody scent almost makes it feel like you have the sun shining on you with the aquatic freshness making this an experience.  (I can\u2019t stop smelling myself as I\u2019m writing this)\n\r\nThe sillage and projection on first spray is very good, and it for me, has very good longevity.  I sprayed it on my hand and arm before going to sleep and it was still there when I woke up.  \n\r\nThis is just in time for summer, and with the woody notes and in my opinion is extremely versatile (might even be more versatile than Profumo) and could be worn year round even in the winter.  Highly recommended, especially if you are a fan of the Acqua Di Gio Family, and particularly Profumo.  When this comes to North America go and try it and snatch it up if you can, because this fragrance is going to be huge.",

Available at $19.90 for 100ml retail, though rather quickly put on sale to $12.90 from what I recall, it\u2019s a typically weakly-performing Zara fragrance but really a nice composition as far as scent goes, certainly welcome in the workplace or when I need a stop gap sort of 2-to-3 hour bridge that\u2019s inoffensive yet invigorating.   I\u2019m a fan, mainly because the scent is reliably good despite the performance being subpar, but the latter is contemplated in the price.

			"content": "Guerlain Homme - Guerlain\r\nA classy perfume: calm and confident with a dignitive charm. Kicks off with a cool lime-anisic vibe that morphs into a minty-pine tonality and a soapy bitter-herbal lavender with slightly floral facets. Impression of icecold white rum/vodka which later gets a boozy-spicy tone supported by the liquorice and a note of fatty sheep-wool. The dryout is very smooth, refined and multi-faceted as many notes pop up and interact with eachother. Some raspy sweet tobacco, whiffs of gasoline, creamy woods, salty vetiver, earthy patchouli, cool incense, indolic-urinic musks and the tiniest sight of vanilla. It alltogether shows a magnificent display of warm vs cool impressions that creates great harmony. Also, the dryout seems to 'echo back' the fresh 'rum-on-lime' start which integrates a great natural fraicheur into the structure. Somehow I had a lot of flashbacks to Amouage Dia pour homme while sniffing this, and although that one is a lot more incense orientated, they share the same kind of cohesive soft- and richness through and through. Topmarks for this one- its a great storyteller that captivates its audience without a slightest effort and without the slightest need for showing off at the same time.",

The rum is the strongest however, while the lime and peppermint are in the background. When spraying this on my skin it actually gives me a slight cooling sensation due to the mint. The rum is of the white variety and not bay rum. But together they smell quite pleasant nonetheless. The fragrance overall leans very masculine and is a sort of \"night out\" type of scent. On drydown it gives me nice wafts towards my nose of a very intoxicating (pun intended) mojito which smells better in the air emanating from my skin than if I sniff my skin itself. On the drydown, the rum note gets louder. In the late drydown it changes entirely to a vetiver scent (not unlike Guerlain Vetiver, but tempered with white rum). Sillage is moderate while longevity is quite fantastic at over 10 hours on my skin for me. Overall this is the best true \"mojito\" fragrance in my opinion, and a real masterpiece of perfumery.\n\r\n5/5",

And I occasionally wear it myself. I tried the EDP but there was absolutely no passing it off as a masculine. The EDT I prefer, for the woody aspects seem more prominent and the 'Guerlinade' less fierce. The jasmine top is soft and clean as new linen, and the sweet woody body is a treasure. I could stand for a bit less powder in the end phase but you know what they say about beggars. They don't wear Samsara.\n\r\n  Further edit: The biggest differences between the EDP and EDT versions (at least the older ones)are that the Parfum is fruitier and cloudier, whereas the EDT is more about the sandalwood. This is not to say the Parfum does not have sandalwood in spades - Rather, its top notes are so heavily loaded that the base doesn't present itself as a main feature until several hours have elapsed; Peach, jasmine, and ylang command the stage and direct the spotlight here. Absolutely lovely, just not on me. What really sells me on the EDT is the prevalence of sandalwood, jasmine, and rose, in classic attar style, only softer - like a watercolor image of the oils one might find in India or Pakistan. I understand that many are turned away from Samsara because of its almost 'Poison-like' strength but, worn in small doses, it is still one of my very favorite scents.",

If you have never smelled vintage Muscs Koublai Khan, you would not recognize this piece, however, if you know that scent, you will recognize it (I hope I'm not the only one!). This phase lasted for me approximately 45 minutes. I also had some scent-memories of MPG's Ambre Dore (which I also love), and then...\n\r\nPhase III - this is seriously amazing - I have vintage AA on my right wrist and this on my left - and they are so similar, it's kinda weird! Now, I only used one spray of each, and what I can say about that is, AA still has the most intensity/sillage of the two - however, I plan to try they both with more sprays. I'll report those \"findings\" once I can. \n\r\nSo, all in all, this will be a definite wish-list item! I'm seriously impressed!",

			"content": "Gucci Guilty Cologne\u2019s  reception seems to be lukewarm overall, and while I can understand the bar being set fairly high by the three prior releases of 2017 and 2018\u2014Guilty Absolute Pour Homme / Pour Femme and Guilty Oud\u2014and I agree with some that find there to be a sort of calone-like prominence that makes for a very sharp marine vibe..\n\r\nHowever, I don\u2019t find Gucci Guilty Cologne to be synthetic or general to the point of being unenjoyable\u2014quite the opposite, as I really enjoy it, though I do have a little bit of difficulty describing it.  It smells mainly of bergamot, cypress, violet, and, as mentioned before, a bit of a calone vibe, though no such note is listed. \n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s fresh, but quite sharp, and I imagine that\u2019s what turns some people off to it, but that it\u2019s a bit biting is part of what makes it interesting to me, perhaps not quite as inoffensive as its cologne name suggests.  It performs pretty well but not anything outstanding\u2014it\u2019s loud during its opening couple of hours and then fades fairly quickly into a skin scent.   It\u2019s a nice option for casual or daytime summer wearing, in my opinion.\n\r\nAs with the retail pricing of the other beloved Gucci Guilty offerings, Cologne\u2019s pricing of $95 for 90ml / $75 for 50ml is a reasonably tough sell, even tougher than the bolder, stronger Absolutes and Oud, so this would need to be a discount, grey market, or p2p type of sale.  Still, I\u2019m happy I blind bought it.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

That role was played by the EAU version from 2016.\n\r\nWhat this cologne is instead, is just that: a cologne, in the traditional sense.  But even then it is experimental at best, much like the Absolute version was a risky turn fantastic offering. \n\r\nThere is a clearer connection to the Absolute version than to the original that this is a flanker to.  Once you divorce yourself from the idea that there *should* be a connection, this flanker is a lot easier to accept.\n\r\nA. Morillas is a genius no doubt; but with hundreds (240 at last count) of mass produced (and mostly successful) creations, I think he is more interested in 'playful' offerings rather than meeting a specific guideline.  \n\r\nGucci Guilty Absolute is perhaps the GREATEST to my nose.\r\nGucci Guilty Cologne is the EdC strength of a 50% tincture of the Absolute.

			"content": "Gucci has been taking some creative risks under new leadership to steer itself away from the samey corporate nadir it was starting to suffer after leaving the LVMH umbrella, in an attempt to avoid the fate it would otherwise share with Parfums Yves Saint Laurent, another former LVMH house brand that moved on under new ownership. The creative director responsible for Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme (2017) is also responsible for this flanker, Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme (2019), bringing back Alberto Morillas as well to have more creative control with the brief than he is usually allowed by other design houses whom hire him. Naturally, Alberto Morillas has become known as quite a prolific perfumer, but with half of that profile earned due to his whipping boy status within the industry, delivering exactly what clients ask for to the letter (in recent years doing so with the assistance of AI), he is not so trusted of a choice among enthusiasts anymore. Computer help or not, Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme showed Morillas can still be creatively provocative if allowed, and I feel the same intent is present with the creation of Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme. As the name suggests, this is a lightweight fresh fragrance meant for appropriate use where something like this would perform better than a heavier ambroxan clubber or woody amber perfume like the kind this house has issued throughout the years prior.\n\r\nGucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme doesn't rely on traditional neroli accords, aquatic aromachemicals, or dry herbal citrus compositions like most modern freshies, although it does contain a hit of bergamot in the opening, but instead leads into a sweet-ish juniper-focused white floral bouquet that will not be of mass appeal. The juniper is rather dominant despite being a top note, and will carry all the way into the final dry down, so people not fond of the note should take heed when testing. A softened violet heart rounded by heliotrope comprise this bouquet, dried by only a bit of rosemary and what appears to be the \"clearwood\" captive from Firmenich. Similar to other synthetic wood notes but not dark or scratchy, it provides the carrier wave for the florals without adding weight, being listed as a \"cypress\" note. I suppose in an interpretive way this does feel rather like a chypre of sorts (from the \"cypress\"), but then the white musk, denatured white patchouli, and Iso E Super come in to cream up then polish this into a \"men's Apres L'Ond\u00e9e (1906)\" white floral vibe before becoming something which lingers when the sun goes down. Sillage is not powerful but longevity is sufficient enough for daytime casual use. Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme is too dandy for the office with its unisex-leaning powdery floral composition, but I also feel it is too synthetic for the kinds of people who in theory root for these creative experiments within the designer realm. \n\r\nLet's face it: the kind of perfume buyers wishing designers took more risks like this also wish real sandalwood, oakmoss, and other absolutes were still used, and they can meet all of their requirements either in pricey vintages or even pricier niche, with no respect given to use of captives like \"clearwood\" or \"timbersilk\" no matter how clever. Likewise, the \"dudebros\" who are okay with synthetics but too concerned with compliments and towing the line with popular style wouldn't appreciate the artistic exercise here, and unlike Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme, this cologne flanker isn't challenging enough to attract the \"bold statement\" guys either. The people who will appreciate this most are the inbetweeners that don't choose to align with either the \"Hatfields\" or \"McCoys\" of the fragrance community, but are still better-versed than the general buying public. These are guys who wear feminine perfumes when agreeable, modern bottles of vintage scents where adequate, niche scents where a good deal is had, and designer fare where the experience outweighs whatever clout losses they may face admitting they like a populist perfume to their \"fraghead\" pals. If that's you, and you want a fresh fragrance that won't smell like a million bucks but also won't smell like anything else, Gucci Guilty Cologne Pour Homme has you covered. My approval will likely be a minority voice, but I still give it a thumbs up.",

I wear a lot of Millesime Imperial during the summer, same with Mandarino di Amalfi, Virgin Island Water, etc. etc. \n\r\nSun Song gives me an option to wear something a little bit different, but something that still plays very well in the hot weather. It's easy for work, easy to wear casually or a bit more dressed up. It's just a really pleasant fragrance. This performs well, wears nicely and is an awesome warmer weather scent. LV has really nice 2ml samples available, and if you're looking for something in this realm, go check it out! A big winner in my book.",

			"content": "At first I thought I like it a bit less than the original Souffle, because it forgoes the lemony start for orange blossom - quite a lot of orange blossom! Later it dries down similarly to original Souffle, but it has less of this lemoncake vibe - it's more like musky vanilla goodness, a little bit deeper and a tiny bit sultrier. Now I almost think I like the drydown of this even more than original Souffle's. \n\r\nSouffle d'Oranger seems to go through more development through the course of the wear than original Souffle which seems more linear to me/on me. If the lemoncake accord has bothered you in the original Souffle and you love orange blossom, I think you might like to test out the Shalimar Souffle d'Oranger. It's less lemony-lemoncake-y, more floral and therefore a bit more \"serious\". \n\r\nIt's probably not different enough to own both unless you're a collector of Shalimar flankers or you don't care for some possible redundancy anyway, but it is quite a different spin on Souffle. And a very pleasant one - in a spectacular bottle. If you enjoy original Souffle, love orange blossom and the lemoncake vibe isn't exactly what you're after, you're probably going to love this.\n",

The opening effulgence of light, watery, fruity rose notes mingling with an equally sun-dappled and non-cloying honey effect is genius. It would have been easy to have done this kind of pairing with oriental sturm und drang, instead we get a sparkling realization of the colour-as-light theme intended. \r\nExperimentum is like being under a fantasy waterfall, each droplet sparkling in the sun and bursting with fragrance.  There are nods to oud-y Middle Eastern roses here, and to woody patchoulied roses in the niche fashion, but the difference is in the dancing quality of the expression, a firefly delight far removed from ponderousness. These are old ideas (particularly the rose-cumin juxtaposition) but appearing in novel raiment. \r\nSuch exciting surface movement cannot be maintained for long and the drydown is a somewhat more traditional woody rose, but even here the cool, dewy quality of the rose impression makes it just that little bit different.      \n",

			"content": "Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme (2006) has had enough flankers both standard and limited edition to give your average Calvin Klein scent a run for its money, and Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme Cologne Bleue (2018) is yet another stick to toss on the pile. Juliet Karagueuzoglou is the contributing perfumer here, and her contributions to the the L'Homme line are brought up to 3 with this flanker. Additionally, she is responsible for the 2018 reboot of Invictus Aqua (2016), which unsurprisingly shares some DNA with L'Homme Cologne Bleue. Overall, we get the original L'Homme reinterpreted as an aquatic, which is not something anyone really asked for, yet is executed astonishingly well all things considered. I don't see anyone losing their minds to get a bottle of this, but for YSL L'Homme fans, Cologne Bleue might just be the summer fix you need. Anyone not smitten on the L'Homme line or not keen on aquatics will likely be able to safely pass this one up, as it feels like catalog padding anyway. However, if you absolutely must have an aquatic version of Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme, today is your lucky day.\n\r\nThe opening of L'Homme Cologne Bleue is very close to a merge between the lightly redolent apple of the original L'Homme and the fruity retro 90's freshness of Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue (2017). Mandarin and grapefruit join the apple, with a smidge of bergamot and pink pepper reminiscent of Bleu de Chanel (2010). Cardamom spice, mild lavender, geranium, and the dreaded dihydromyrcenol \"aquatic\" notes join in the heart, bringing a contrast of warm and cool along with a hint of classic barbershop vibe, providing a bit more connective tissue to past YSL foug\u00e8res like Kouros (1981) or Rive Gauche Pour Homme (2003), but without the staunch masculinity of either. Finally, this settles on the original YSL L'Homme woody amber base with creamy sandalwood, sharp cedar, Iso E Super, and only a light touch of the 2010's wondernote known as ambroxan. Wear time is a middling 6+ hours but sillage is adequate to get the point across.\n\r\nOnce again, those who live inside the Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme bubble will be all over this already, and it manages to offer a cooler alternative to L'Homme in the same manner La Nuit de L'Homme Eau \u00c9lectrique (2017) did for the original La Nuit de L'Homme (2009); but with so many flankers and flankers of flankers beating this line to death, the real question of whether or not we needed another aquatic iteration in the line needs be asked. Didn't Yves Saint Laurent recently make Y Eau de Toilette (2017) and Y Eau de Parfum (2018) just to address this problem with a marine ambergris-themed new pillar? I don't know, but L'Homme Cologne Bleue is pleasant and well-constructed enough for what it is to avoid a thumbs down or neutral, but the jury is still out on how needed this was. As always, your nose will have to be the judge on how redundant or necessary it is to your wardrobe. This barely squeaks a thumbs up for me and I am not likely to reach for it, but sample for yourself as mileage may vary from person to person.",

			"content": "This must be a joke. Seriously Tom Ford? I get the novelty of Lost Cherry (2018) or even the revolting ridiculousness of Fucking Fabulous (2017) being something that the \"haute bourgeoisie\" totally detached from everyone else's earthbound reality might fall for, but are you even trying anymore with these ultra-expensive limited Private Collection exclusives? If this isn't cynical fleecing of the rich in perfume form, then I don't know what is. From Tom Ford's own website the blurb reads: Tom Ford transcends the traditional limits of scent with Lavender Extr\u00eame. Lavender is reworked and refracted like it never has been before to become something irreverently new, a stunning, electric creation to be worn at maximum volume. Who is this trying to fool? Well, Lavender Extr\u00eame (2019) is absolutely none of that, but rather a nearly note-for-note remake of Pour Un Homme de Caron (1934), which is one of Mr. Ford's own personal favorite perfumes. Lavender Extr\u00eame isn't \"inspired by\" like many of Roja Dove's upscale homages, but rather is a direct reverse-engineering of the venerable Pour Un Homme, duplicating almost everything about it save the slight animalic puff of musk and oakmoss in the orginal's base. \n\r\nLiterally the only difference between the two is that hint of vintage stiffness from the Caron scent, but otherwise we are dealing with photorealistic French lavender over citrus with a tonka-heavy foug\u00e8re base. Lavender Extr\u00eame opens with a rather non-extreme blanket of the barbershop flower, with lemon to keep it fresh, and a direct descent into coumarin. Bergamot and rosemary are missing from the Tom Ford but it does share the dandy rose heart, replacing the Caron's sage with geranium to keep the scent floral and a tad sharper than Caron Pour Un Homme. Vanilla is also substituted for cinnamon in Lavender Extr\u00eame, which dials back the roundness found in the Caron a bit more, but also hurts the diffusion of the scent overall, making it feel more linear and ironically cheaper despite costing ten times as much. Once the tonka shows up, the same \"lavender tonka foug\u00e8re two-step\" the Caron is legendary for is present in the Tom Ford scent, and Lavender Extr\u00eame literally just becomes an expensive alternative in a shiny chrome bottle; perfectly and utterly useless to anyone who knows better. Wear time is longer than the old Pour Un Homme due to parfum concentration but one of the saving graces about Pour Un Homme was being able to control how long it lasts, so if you really need a 15-hour lavender bad enough to pay this price, go on. Sillage is moderate, but this is just a lavender scent, so I expected that.\n\r\nThe bottom line here is I just cannot wrap my head around the \"luxury\" of a brand-new prestige-tier \"niche\" fragrance that is functionally and aesthetically identical within a hair's width to a fragrance made 85 years prior and still available for a fraction of the price. If you wore this side-by-side next to somebody doused in Pour Un Homme I would not know the difference from the kind of distance most of us keep to passersby, and if I was given time to analyze what minute differences there are to pick out which person wasn't wearing the Caron, I still wouldn't see the justifiable jump from approximately $35USD to the $320USD you'd need to make for the Tom Ford. I love several of the standard Tom Ford lines and even a few Private Collection entries, but the callousness of this release can't be anything other than a joke, because either Tom Ford is taking the piss big time, or really thinks the people who buy these are that stupid not to even check Google before tossing a car payment at a shiny chrome bottle of lavender, which says a lot about where this market is going. Go ahead and sample this and then Caron Pour Un Homme if you don't believe me, and if you still want it, I'll just be over here quietly shaking my head at you. I don't know whether to give two huge middle fingers or two huge thumbs way down, but this stuff is just unbelievable. ",

That said, it\u2019s a nice semi-sweet, semi-powdery lavender blend that feels easy to wear from the onset, and I\u2019m a fan.\n\r\nThe note listing is fascinating: lavender, lemon, violet, rose, geranium, cinnamon, and tonka.  Primarily a floral bouquet but nonetheless with sweet, spicy, powdery, and citrus influences.  It feels balanced and complete.\n\r\nLike others, I do get a bit of the \u201cPlay-Doh\u201d vibe, particularly at the opening when it\u2019s going through some changes, but by the dry down, I don\u2019t get much of this at all.  Interestingly enough, I\u2019ve had other non-fragheads tell me that they get the same Play-Doh feeling from Dior Mitzah.   It\u2019s not particularly a problem for me in either case.\n\r\nPerformance is decent on my skin but not on the higher end, roughly somewhere in the range of the last two provocative releases of Lost Cherry and Fucking Fabulous, the latter giving slightly better performance on my skin than the former.\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m instantly a fan of the scent itself, but as with most Tom Ford offerings, price is a major issue.  Lavender Extreme is in the higher echelon of Tom Ford pricing, at $320 for 50ml or $815 for the 250ml flacon (I don\u2019t yet see a 100ml size for sale online), so it\u2019s a very tough sell at retail pricing unless you positively love it.\n\r\n8 out of 10",

			"content": "Rasei Fort is a remarkable example of the new generation of independent perfumers: he\u2019s self taught and his work richly evokes the perfumes of yore. In a perfume world where minimalism and blandness are the rule, and aroma chemical concoctions are being sold for small fortunes, some still look to the past for inspiration for scents that are eminently romantic, in the proper sense of the term: beautifully aesthetic, orientated to the great classics, but evoking an imminence. Such perfumes manage to be thoroughly modern, but classic at once.\n\r\nKolonya\u2019s inspiration is Rasei Fort\u2019s own childhood with his grandfather, which immediately explains its melancholic character. Described as a \u201cmemory of a cologne\u201d, it\u2019s striking how beautifully it makes its point: crisp, dry citrus notes dance hand in hand with a superb iris. A beautiful floral heart follows, reminding me of a rich flower garden in the heart of summer: lavender, rose, orange blossom, galbanum and many others. Hours later, it settles into a beautiful skin scent with clean vetiver, hay and sweet tobacco. There\u2019s an elusive plum note here that is a joy when discovered. Kolonya also has a quirky way of wading into attention at just the right time while wearing it, without being overpowering. With an ingredient list as long as my arm, I can\u2019t over-stress how much this perfume can surprise even the most jaded ones among us. \n\r\nThe package perfectly compliments the whole idea behind it: a beautiful rosewood box, that closes just right only in one position, perfectly aligned. The bottle has that 19th century drug store look, and there\u2019s no sprayer here: just pour it on, old-school style (I\u2019ve decanted some into a sprayer, so as not to risk losing any of it, but it diminishes the charm). \n\r\nThis fragrance is at home in the mental landscape the memory occupies: it will bring joy to the hot, dry summer days and nights. This is how Lermontov\u2019s pictures of mountainscapes must have smelled. This is how Lord Byron must have smelled in Greece. This is how turn of the century Istanbul must have smelled. Highly recommended for anyone with a remote interest in perfumery, but especially for the romantics at heart: Rasei Fort\u2019s olfactive memories are an invitation to make your own. With a perfume like this, they\u2019ll at least smell fantastic. ",

			"content": "I'm delighted to finally try out Rasei Fort's release under his own name after having tried all of his creations to date under the Fort & Manle brand, Kolonya, exclusively available via Luckyscent in the US at $120 for a 60ml splash bottle.\n\r\nImmediately, it\u2019s not like most so-called \u201ccologne\u201d fragrances (I\u2019m thinking the Acqua di Parma Colonia line as a prototype).  It doesn\u2019t open with a blast of fresh neroli; it isn\u2019t a bergamusk; nor is it something alcohol-intensive that feels like an aftershave.\n\r\nRather, it\u2019s an interesting, semi-herbal, semi-green, mostly-fresh blend that involves a mix of citruses and a very lengthy note list overall, a few standouts (that I\u2019d like to think I get whiffs of) being petitigrain, rosemary, hay, oakmoss, white pepper, coriander, vetiver, and cedarwood.\n\r\nI doubt I do it justice to speak to notes specifically, though, and rather, my best way to communicate how it feels is to analogize it to something in real life. It has a bit of the smell of actual papyrus but mixed with citruses, herbs, and other woods.  It\u2019s not completely fresh, just mostly fresh with a touch of dryness.  It\u2019s restrained, while being complex and interesting.  It performs decently well, not loud but not light and airy either.\n\r\nThe price point is reasonable, as I usually regarding $2/ml as a good point for niche/independent perfumery, and so I\u2019ll have to give this some strong consideration on the grounds of its uniqueness and inventiveness, attributes I usually assign to Rasei\u2019s creations under the Fort & Manle brand, even those that don\u2019t fit me as well personally as those I love like Amber Absolutely and Bojnokopff.\n\r\nI'm really intrigued by this one--not smitten, but pleased and encouraged to retry, especially given the fair price point.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

			"content": "A very pleasant and enjoyable take on a modern citrus fragrance, Afternoon Swim opens with vibrant fruity notes, both sweet and tart, resembling orange, bergamot, and perhaps grapefruit. What separates AS from an average, mundane citrus is mostly twofold: First, the notes themselves have a very colorful, juicy, lively feeling and come across as something of a bouquet rather than just one singular note or accord. Secondly, they're infused with a subtle, salty-aquatic quality that recalls ambergris and the marine-like dimension of Creed's Millesime Imperial. It's a quality that's present but subtle--lending a seaside breeze to the citrus and really establishing a connection to the fragrance's name. The citrus blend itself is both sweet and tart. In fact, one negative review of Afternoon Swim succinctly summed things ups by stating, \"Smells like Sweet Tarts candy. That's all.\" While I disagree with the general sentiment of the comment, the comparison to Sweet Tarts is pretty accurate--one facet of Swim's citrus notes do in fact resemble the popular candy. But there's more to it than that, of course. \n\r\nRegarding its performance, Afternoon Swim is appropriately sneaky. It goes on with a fresh rush, nice and bright and awakening. Then, in about 20 minutes it settles in and becomes pretty quiet at first. But it doesn't end there: Over the course of the next 4 to 6 hours, Afternoon Swim appears, disappears and reappears in pleasant, vivid wafts as you wear it. It doesn't persist with one, linear pulse, but rather it fades in and out in a breezy, relaxed manner that seems to suit the fragrance well. If you're looking for a powerhouse citrus, look elsewhere, but if you can appreciate a fragrance that weaves in and out over the course of its average to slightly above average longevity, this is a good choice.\n\r\nOverall AS feels very modern and fresh--it's well-suited for the summer and spring--and though I can't imagine using it much in the colder months, I think it could work well in an indoor office environment as a generally casual, pleasing smell that is never too intrusive. The fragrance's presentation is a treat--from bottle to box everything is a high- quality pleasure to behold. A bit more complex and clever than it first appears, Louis Vuitton's Afternoon Swim brings a bright citrus fragrance to the market with enough nuance to make it stand out from the crowd.

Immediately on application, there is something here that reminds me of something Lush or BPAL would make: burned sugar crossed with the headshop murkiness of amber cubes and dragon\u2019s blood incense, or some mysterious dried herb concoction in a burlap sack. It smells very indie \u2013 not in the super-fancy artisanal sense of the word, but more in the sense of the Etsy crowd dropping a Solstice or Hexennacht release of perfumes honoring the Moon or witches or something. Not saying that to knock it, by the way \u2013 many of my favorite perfumes are indie oils from the latter category (I am just not into the witchy side of things).\n\r\nI smell in Sangre Dulce a whole host of confusing but really pleasing notes that seem to hang together very well \u2013 burned sugar, rubber galoshes, sugar mashed into dirt, bathtub booze, and in the far drydown, something that smells like over-baked wheatgrass and granola bars (maybe this is where that protein bar ended up). If Luca Turin were to smell this, I\u2019d imagine he\u2019d find a way to praise Prin Lomros for his off-the-wall thinking, in the same way he (almost wistfully) loves the Constantine father and son duo at Lush for having the guts to just throw everything into a pot as a mad experiment and see what works (\u201cSomeone seems to be having a lot of fun over there\u201d as he might say, in that impish way of his).\n\r\nA basic way to describe Sangre Dulce is to say that it smells like sugar cubes and burned wheat that took a wrong turn somewhere and fell down a dark cellar into a pot of hooch, dragging with it some Converse sneakers and a vial of herbal folk medicine.

There are gourmand elements to it but it's not a gourmand fragrance, if that makes sense.\n\r\nPerformance is perfect for me. Excellent longevity (12 hours) but moderate, even soft projection which makes it a great office scent. The bottle and art work are also very unique. The entirety of the fragrance is just really stunning to me, unique, different, but still pleasing. It's become a 1x a week staple of my wardrobe. Big thumbs up from me.",

			"content": "A fine orange spice fragrance built upon a base of red woody spiced tea mulled in oranges and settling down into a warm amber base.  The red tea is either rooibos tea or chinese red tea which becomes black tea when roasted.  I am betting the spices come from the dry bark like woody rooibos tea that has a spiced sarsaparilla tea and I pick up this in the scent. The result is a good, not great, simple and satisfying orange spiced woody amber tea fragrance. The bottle design of coiled dragon and named Winter Palace playfully refers to Game of Thrones Winterfell palace - a beautiful presentation and reason enough to purchase this one for me. As Game of Thrones is now over and fading from thought - I suggest to test it before you buy.  It's worth it to me, but I like spice scents very much.",

			"content": "Memo Winter Palace is the Paris house\u2019s most recent and only 2019 release, to date, of which I\u2019m aware. I\u2019d immediately describe it as a sort of spicy orange cream.  Its mix of citruses (grapefruit, bergamot, lemon), vanilla, benzoin, labdanum, balsam, and musk facilitates such a feeling, though I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the mate and red tea that give the fragrance its certain kick.\n\r\nI own a couple of fragrances that I\u2019d describe as being orange cream-like (Profumum Roma Mergina and Lili Bermuda SunKiss) but Winter Palace is darker and especially spicier than either.  I still think it\u2019s fair to call Winter Palace a gourmand\u2014and a fairly indulgent one, at that\u2014but it\u2019s not as sweet or bright as either of the two aforementioned fragrances, so it\u2019s refreshing that it deviates a bit and goes into different territory.  I quite like it, even if I prefer the other two, overall.  \n\r\nIt feels versatile, like it\u2019s serious and dark enough for going out and winter, respectively, but still sweet and playful and somewhat fresh enough to be worn casually or in summer.\n\r\nWinter Palace is priced at $295-300 for the standard 75ml Memo bottle size is available at Luckyscent, Neiman Marcus, and its house site, though I suspect, like most other entries in the house, it\u2019ll be available on the grey market at a discount, which is the case for Tiger\u2019s Nest, only released last year.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "According to Wordforde Perfumers, \"Root of all Goodness is probably the finest vetiver-styled fragrance on the market today.\" Well, that's clearly quite some claim given the number of acclaimed vetivers on the market. I will go so far as to say that ROAG is the best vetiver I have tried - and I've tried a few. \n\r\nThe point of departure for Parterre is that they grow the key ingredients themselves. In this case, the vetiver is English vetiver - I know, who would have thought it! - grown on site in Dorset. We don't know exactly which ingredients are local, and which brought in, but one thing for sure that the label has brought in is French perfumer Jacques Chabert to put together the components into three scents, of which this is the most masculine. \n\r\nAnother certainty is that ROAG just does it for me, period. The bergamot-vetiver-leather structure works as well as a three-act play. The vetiver has neither the aggressive astringency of Guerlain's vetiver, nor the sinister dankness of Encre Noire. Rather, it is textured and resinous, and perhaps more believably woody. A little bit of ginger creeps into the early stages, while the dry-down is accompanied by labdanum.\n\r\nROAG also responds well to the volume control. A few sprays and it works like a masculine cologne. Heavier application ensures a presence for most of the day. It's never loud and won't appeal to many on the basis of performance, but this is not about brashness. Despite a certain rawness - I expect reformulation in some way if the label continues - this is English refinement done extremely well. \n\r\nThe packaging is exquisite and includes an invitation for a tour of the Dorset farm. Amounts are very limited so I find it hard to recommend until I have a back-up bottle. One of the few fragrances I've ever tried that I would rave about.  ",

The perfume fits the name \u2013 these are white flowers playing a part, made up, wearing costumes, revelling in artifice. Here they display only their honeyed essence \u2013 anything indolic or green-fresh about the odour profile is banished. And this unctuous sweetness is dressed beautifully \u2013 with a tobacco accord that is cured and mild and touched by cloves, and with vanilla that merges into the baccy but retains a rubbery, almost chewy otherness. At times this curious mix teeters too much towards artifice and reminds me of bubble gum, before it rights itself again and regains its rich sophistication. Slicing right through the perfume, from opening to end, is the resinous base, almost like a thin layer of silica, adding a contrast to the sweetness yet also bending to its will.\r\nIt\u2019s a creation with a strong personality and so won\u2019t be for everyone \u2013 but in it I see a half-sister to something as wilful as Dior\u2019s Poison, some of the same genes but with different fathers. Still, it doesn\u2019t quite touch greatness, as it is let down, some hours in, by its drydown. Now all the playfulness comes to an end and it turns into a rather straightforward vanilla-smudged sweet white floral.

			"content": "Portrayal is very strong for the first hour. It opens with the sharp, bracing, soapy bite of a huge violet note. Violets can come across three ways to me: green and leaf-like, with damp, watery, plant-like qualities; purple and somewhat spicy-sweet in the manner of violet candies, almost how pink pepper is spicy- sweet; or gray and almost dry, bitter and somewhat soapy. In Portrayal, the violet consists of all three varieties. It's a robust, multi-dimensional violet and is absolutely the star of the show. But that's not to suggest that it's the only note at play. Perhaps its the spiciness of the purple violet variety, but there also seems to be some kind of cloves or pepper working here, embellishing Portrayal with a distinct piquancy. It could also be interpreted as geranium, whose cold, spiciness is also marked by a nearly edible sweetness. I'm also almost positive coriander shows up for a moment, or maybe to a lesser degree, cumin, layered near the bottom, because there is a very subtle sweaty funk simmering below, which fades out early in Portrayal's development. There could also be oakmoss, as a certain part of Portrayal reminds me of popular 70's and 80's powerhouses like Antaeus, which used oakmoss in part with animalics like castoreum to create this clean-but-dirty contrast. This smell is captured completely in the relatively new Slumberhouse release, New Sibet. But it's also here in Portrayal, supporting its huge violet note. It gradually recedes in the first hour until it's barely perceptible when Portrayal eventually reaches its heart. I don't smell \"cade\" anywhere, if cade is supposed to smell smoky, like wood burning, or tar (it's possible I'm just not familiar enough with cade as a note, but I don't detect any kind of smokiness in Portrayal). And I definitely do not smell vetiver. If it's there, it's been submerged into obscurity. \n\r\nAfter about an hour, much of Portrayal's dynamic, and at times, aggressive beginnings settle in. The fragrance becomes calmer, more singularly focused and with less activity than before. It's as if the various aspects and styles of violet that were branching out earlier have now been reeled in, and instead of three different violets, each doing their own thing and making up different dimensions of the scent, there is now one singular violet serving its center. Furthermore, the flashes of cloves and coriander, the spiciness and hint of sweat, are completely settled in, barely detectable. And it's exactly that violet that comes together after some time that has the \"Fahrenheit smell.\" Granted, nothing about Portrayal reminded me of Fahrenheit until a full hour after wearing it, and even then it's quite different. The violet that smells like the violet in Fahrenheit, is surrounded by a much more dry, bitter green element in Portrayal. It's soapier with more whites and greens and grays than Fahrenheit's swirling reds. Looking at it from the perspective of percentages, Portrayal is maybe 20% Fahrenheit, so it's really not much like it at all. For what it's worth, I enjoy Fahrenheit much more. It's a masterpiece with an unforgettable character both bizarre and charming. Portrayal isn't much of either. That's not to say it's bad in any regard--it's actually a decent composition--but at least as far as I'm concerned, it lacks that certain something to really win me over and want to keep coming back for more. \n\r\nPortrayal is not an easy scent to pull off and I can't see it going over very well with many young audiences, especially young Americans. Though it softens up after some time, it comes out of the gate with gusto, reminding us in some ways of past powerhouses and a style that was popular decades ago. Its violet note is loud and powerful, almost aggressive, and extremely \"soapy\" at times. But it's also interesting, and substantial. Not until it settles in does Portrayal become a more relaxed and easy-going wear. By hour 2 or 3 it's moderately pleasant, the sweet, aromatic, Fahrenheit-like violet note wafting softly around its clean, bitter-green environs. But it's a challenge getting there. Final rating, 6/10, worth sampling only if you love violet. ",

In the evolution, the ozone  and sea spray dissipate and even the persistence of the violet leaf gets challenged by that spicy dirty-fresh woody backing which is the main feature of the drydown.

			"content": "\r\nAllow me to confess that I really enjoy my Neroli concoctions as well as musk concoctions, from clean to near debaucherous. As to the former this means I have really enjoyed much of Jean Claude Ellena\u2019s canon as much as the numerous Italian interpretations of citrus-infused wonders \u2013 both those that are uplifting and those that are more staid when I wear my gentleman pants \u2013 that seem to evoke walks along the Mediterranean between refreshments on hot days.\n\r\nRegarding Byredo\u2019s Sundazed (2019), after reading the ingredient listing and partaking in a short experience at the Byredo counter I wondered if this would be tantamount to Jean-Claude Ellena having a sugar rush and falling into a coma?\n\r\nStill intrigued I took some samples with me to try and figure this out.\n\r\nOh wow, upon application this one is immediately evocative. More accurately, it was memory-inducing from the opening but this was all quite inadvertent as I had not set out to imagine what this scent was. I was attempting to be pragmatic in noting this. From 0-60 upon application I was met with a loud cotton candy note (I want to say \u201ccotton candy accord,\u201d only because that sounds delightfully funny!). Memories came flooding back to me. From the knock-knock on my mind\u2019s door and thereupon opening it I see myself at a local fairground smelling the pungent sugary sweets and their steamy aromas that crept through the hot air and invaded the already excited children all around me. Wow, that is indeed cotton candy to start this journey. How is this not in the top notes? More to come, I am certain.\n\r\nWithin minutes the mandarin joins in and pushes this towards something more orange creamsical, though it never quite entirely goes there as something floral is detected in the background. I am already aghast as the super sweet opening has taken me out of my normal comfort zone, and I am a little confused by how my usual love of orange-led scents has been somewhat pillaged by the cotton candy. But of course we have the answer: this is mandarin, something that is intendedly prescribed here to maintain the sweetness content. Make no mistake, this is more sugar than \u2018sweet\u2019 in the world of fragrance.\n\r\n(Note: for reference sake this is called \u201ccandy floss\u201d \u2013 where I come from we just call it cotton candy).\n\r\nMy initial reaction was suspect, for I feared we\u2019d have no lift off. Instead I worried that Sundazed was just a sweet orange creamsical-inspired skirmish across the runway with the initial candied heat of orange usurping our attention until we sputter out and fail to take to the skies after all.\n\r\nI am happy to report that I was wrong. Very wrong.\n\r\nAfter the mandarin orange and cotton candy fireworks I can detect the lemon, although it was always sorta there. The dry lemon assumes a more nominal position and this, combined with a rising Jasmine note, tempers and then controls this blast of hot sugary air from Candy Mountain. When it comes the change in tempo is significant. With that in mind, I hope I haven\u2019t lost anyone yet with the overly descriptive but accurate sugary opening because change is afoot \u2013 stick around! For within 20-30 minutes the mandarin plunge is replaced by a perfectly balanced universe between a soapy neroli and jasmine. The opening mandarin and cotton candy carousel is slowed down and harnessed, thus succeeding in directing this fragrance onto a more harmonious plane of floral, bitter orange and a clean white musk. Despite a preview of the notes did not see that coming in the manner in which it played out.\n\r\nThe once seemingly impenetrable, hazy, ozonic cloud of cotton candy has now settled alongside or just below our heart and we are left with the observation that we are, in actuality, dealing with a well-thought out journey utilizing some high-quality ingredients. The neroli and jasmine are outstanding, and we are led back to a strong reminder that Byredo is a quality niche house. It seems they know what they are doing in conducting this voyage. This is floral, soapy neroli in a good way. The lush jasmine would seem to be captured just at that moment when the flowers fall (you know if you\u2019ve had jasmine plants). And what makes this so intriguing is that I keep getting these continuous, though more diluted and gentle, wafts of cotton candy that appear amongst the bouquet. A clean, white musk holds this in place without making it too heavy. As a fan of many varieties of musk (clean, dirty, sensual, soapy, etc.) this one does not take over too soon and forces the other ingredients to settle down. By the 1-hour mark the mandarin is gone (or contained) because there really isn\u2019t room or reason for it at this point. By the 2-hour mark this has settled into a happy skin scent. Where once it was sharp, sweet and slightly bitter we move into a dry down that clean, warm and evidently flavoured by the mid-afternoon sun. No woods, not really earthy, possibly a little green with a slightly sweet breeze. Sundazed is really the definition of a non-linear experience.\n\r\nI\u2019m a little confused by this fragrance. But even more so I am intrigued. (1) On a personal level, going in I knew that this was slightly outside my usual charts that capture my attention, so I\u2019m surprised. Did I just discover that I like a little more floral with my de facto love of neroli? Or perhaps I\u2019m discovering that, in fact, what I\u2019m witnessing is my own (admittedly new) curiosity about florals in general, particularly without woods to ease it? While I have certainly sampled floralist attributes in fragrances leaning that way I almost never appreciate them enough to request/accept a sample, much less make a full bottle acquisition. (2) On the other hand, I am a little confused due to the way this was described at the Byredo counter as it belies the fact that this is, in essence, a dominant floral-neroli-citrus composition. Yes, it\u2019s held aloft by a clean white musk and made more intriguing by natural (mandarin) and candied (cotton candy) sweet notes. But the Byredo consultants insisted on the primacy of the sweet accords. I\u2019m not complaining because ultimately intrigue got the best of me and that is why I am here now. Where originally it felt as something composed for a young and upwardly mobile urbanite in some noted cultural industry to recapture memories on carefree Summer days, the reality is that the progression of Sundazed makes it all that plus an unexpectedly sophisticated experience.\n\r\nFor my skin sillage is average (about 3-4 hours) and projection is relatively low. It\u2019s a sweet, short projection (maybe 1-2 hours) and thus it might be best advised to spray it on your clothes also. It\u2019s worth it.\n\r\nThis is Summer. Not a Summer citrus with sel de mer along a natural coastline, not a fresh and raw vetiver while enjoying a spritzer on the piazza, and it\u2019s certainly not an ozonic aquatic of the virile XY chromosome set. This is a Summer scent reminding us of ice cream after swimming lessons at the pool. It\u2019s Summer braking for lemonade while our parents grabbed espressos on our vacation. It\u2019s a Summer of a sort of uplifting yet ethereal memory. But this is not a child\u2019s Summer (forgive my own references) as the evolution of Sundazed became something quite unexpected, very intriguing, inviting, highly- wearable, and, yes, sophisticated. Byredo\u2019s alignment with memory is an undeniable part of this experience.\n\r\nThis is an enjoyable, very happy scent. To those who heard it was sweet? \u2013 well, 80% of that rumour is just the initial cotton candy-mandarin opening. The more I think about it the more I believe this is an intelligent design that ensures that this unique sweetness settles down nicely into the mid-frame where it might otherwise disappear. It thus allows the cotton candy to hold a place just below what this fragrance really is . . . a delightful soapy floral-neroli experience that is light and highly-wearable for casual situations and (perhaps) work in warm weather. And yet there is something that is also pointedly sentimental about Sundazed; it truly evokes hot Summer afternoons and the immobile laziness of it all. It feels worry-free, light, uplifting and free from the humdrum aquatic and amped-up citrus interpretations we usually find for Summer. In fact, I might even say that Sundazed was less made for Summer as instead it was Summer that made Sundazed.\n\r\nAnd that leads me to conclude that it was aptly named. That\u2019s my day in the sun.\r\n       .\r\n       .\r\n       .\r\n(UPDATE:  I wore this for the entirety of the August long weekend, attending various social events and music parties. I carried an atomizer to reapply at various times throughout the day in all that sunshine, as well as evening refreshes. I adored being with this scent. And friends and strangers kept commenting on it, equally men and women. In fact, once early evening came I applied some on my friends and they were absolutely taken with the progression of notes much the same way they were with the music. So much so that a few stated they would be acquiring it for themselves, no matter the lofty cost. To be sure, it\u2019s seasonal time is limited  -  it\u2019s a Summer scent alluding to our past Summer glories in those hot days/evenings  -  but this one is a resounding success!!)\n\n\n",

			"content": "Launched in early May 2019, Eau de Minthe is Diptyque's modern take on a classic fougere (fern) accord. The traditional lavender is replaced here with mint; a fresh herb that is usually a top note in fragrances.\n\r\nAs such, I found the fragrance name a little misleading. The mint is not the leading star of the show here. Instead, it makes its appearance from the outset and is short-lived. It seems a little shy and doesn't shout out from the balcony. It is muted, tamed even, yet woven together expertly with earthy patchouli (perhaps there are hints of nutmeg there too) and geranium. On my skin, the patchouli jumps out loudest of all, with the other notes playing their tune quietly in the background. I detect no rose as such.\n\r\nEventually the fougere dry-down soon takes over, leaving a relatively strong trail of freshness and just a touch of sweetness creeping through. It was enough to keep me smelling my hands every few minutes and I was soon hooked. On a tester/blotter, the scent retains the accord for several days even with few sprays, so I bet this one will cling to clothes quite nicely.\n\r\nDiptyque continues its history and obsession with everything to do with Greece or Greeks - from the herbaceous and incense-fumed mountains of Mt. Athos (L'Eau Trois), to the mythological cinnamon-opoponax 'favourite' of Alexander the Great (Eau Lente) and the fragrance of fresh green figs (Philosykos) - comes the tale of Minthe and Hades. If Hades smelled this good, he must have had style. As a Greek, it's hard not to love this brand.\n\r\nAll in all, this is nothing groundbreaking as a new scent. But it is a fresh fougere minus the lavender and for some people this may well be a modern take on a classic and will likely satisfy even the most demanding vintage scent enthusiasts. Just what we've been waiting for. Well done, Diptyque!",

			"content": "Diptyque has entered the time-honored world of the foug\u00e8re once again on their own terms with the release of Eau de Minth\u00e9 (2019). As with everything this house does, Eau de Minth\u00e9 is \"very Diptyque\" in the sense that there is a singular focus on a note, as was the case with their previous foug\u00e8re Geranium Oderata (2014). Eau de Minth\u00e9 puts a lovely smooth spearmint front and center, then builds a foug\u00e8re accord around it, giving this a fresher sort of barbershop feel than traditional varieties focused on spice and wood. I don't think vintage foug\u00e8re fans will appreciate this as much as fans of niche perfume who are overall more open to the interpretation of the foug\u00e8re accord, as there are heavy aromatics, no fat tonka and oakmoss base, no skanky or dandy florals, and no musky vanillic or clove riff midway, but fans of mint will sure take notice. Eau de Minth\u00e9 really feels like a nod to male wet shaver culture and that's the demographic I can see going after this scent the most, but anyone who appreciates the minty aspects of scents like Cartier Roadster (2008) or Concentr\u00e9e d'Orange Verte (2004) should also investigate.\n\r\nEau de Minth\u00e9 opens swiftly with that lovely spearmint, sourced from Oregon according to Diptyque advertising (sourcing claims are always dubious in the industry anymore), with a bit of IFRA-approved vacuum-distilled bergamot to convey rather than the sharp bergamot oils of old. Rose and geranium deliver a dose of geraniol without feeling dandy thanks to the dry sage standing in for lavender, leaving none of the spiky opening or rounded sweetness usually occuring in old-school foug\u00e8res that might nullify the mint if present. Fans of Dirty by Lush (2004) should take note, as a similar aerosol shaving cream vibe occurs midway in, with nutmeg replacing the tarragon found in dirty to make Eau de Minth\u00e9 feel more prim and proper than the rugged DIY nature of the Lush scent. There are slivers of oakmoss and tonka in the base, but a dry patchouli, vetiver, and Australian/New Caledonian sandalwood finish do most of the talking, giving Eau de Minth\u00e9 a teeny bit of callback to Diptyque Tam Dao (2003). Wear time is average at about 7+ hours and sillage is also about median in power, as most mint-focused scents lack any deep gravity, with Eau de Minth\u00e9 being no different. \n\r\nSomething fresh but non-aquatic like this would have made an excellent eau de toilette and eau de parfum pair for the house, but it seems like Diptyque is uninterested in making any new eau de toilettes anymore since like so many of the other older niche houses (hello Serge Lutens), Diptyque wants to get in on that nouveau riche tech industry money in lieu of their hardcore fanbase by slowly sliding upmarket with pricier exclusive eau de parfum lines being the only option to try their latest creations, and may shelve EdT varieties althougher like Creed has. I see it making sense with ouds and other rich orientals, but not something so \"blue collar\" as what is more or less just fancy Mennen Skin Bracer (1931) with a small dab of Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Pour Homme (2002). Still, this is really freaking good for a mint scent, despite not having a ton of complexity. Eau de Minth\u00e9 is simply a good after-bath spritz or daily no-nonsense fresh wear for somebody tired of citrus or aquatic colognes. Diptyque Eau de Minth\u00e9 is worthy of a sniff for anyone looking into minty scents or barbershop foug\u00e8res but apprehensive about grandfather's bottle of Canoe (1936). Thumbs up! ",

Green fresh opening coupled with dry labdanum + cool woods base. Rating: 8/10 stars.",

In the background there\u2019s a dab of creamy rum and a few shavings of wood, but it\u2019s that hint of mould that gives the zesty citrus character without weighing it down.\r\nHowever, like many of Guillaume\u2019s creations, the whizzes have banged within an hour or two. This time all one is left with after that time is a faint musky hum.\n",

Usually this process uses tuberose as its base and includes jasmine and various lily oils.\n\r\nHove\u2019s Gardenia opens with a redolence of tuberose, but with a grounding of what seems like an artemisia or sandalwood base (my spouse detects a mintiness as well), which calms it down a bit and grounds it. The dry down brings this base forward to the detriment of the gardenia effect.\n\r\nComparison to New Orleans\u2019 only other perfumery, Bourbon French Parfums, is inevitable and surprising. BF\u2019s Gardenia seems to my nose a truer blend than does Hove\u2019s. It is not tuberose dominant, smells much closer to the actual Gardenia, and has a noble but subdued sweetness, similar to the effect of Ylang Ylang, that is true to the gardenia flower, but which is absent in the Hove version.\n\r\nIn this contest the Bourbon French Gardenia is the winner and the preferred choice.\n",

			"content": "Hove \u2013 Ginger Blanc\n\r\nI have no idea if the oil of the Hawaiian White Ginger Lily carries its own scent or if, like the Gardenia, it has no scent, necessitating the creation of a scent by mixing other oils.\n\r\nIf this is so, my impression here is of tuberose and jasmine. There is the olaceous headiness of tuberose and the green tinge of jasmine absolute present here. The Ginger Lily does remind a number of reviewers of jasmine, so the use of that oil would be considered appropriate in a Ginger Lily composition.\n\r\nThe Hove is quite strong and beautiful. It is more of a success than their Gardenia. Comparing it to the White Ginger of New Orleans\u2019 only other parfumerie, Bourbon French, I find that the BF White Ginger is entirely different, coming closest to the banana-like scent of ylang ylang without any hint of tuberose or jasmine. If you recall a soft candy of the 20th century, in the shape of a peanut, (the scent was that of banana \u2013 go figure - and the company was Spangler), the scent is remarkably similar. \n\r\nIn summation, both the Hove and Bourbon French versions of White Ginger are excellent, just entirely different. If I ever actually inhale the aroma of a White Ginger Lily, I will edit this review, comparing both of the above to the real thing.\n",

Along with the typical Indian  and Moroccan aromatic spices you have some prickly and thorny bits like artemisia, pepper and saffron which add character to the lively spices; and in the base are hypnotic spiraling inhalant notes of gurjun balsam, lavender and guaiac wood.  These elements rest atop a warm amber, vetiver and sandalwood base.  This is one of the nicer pure spice blends I have smelled in recent history and I am a big fan of spice fragrances. So many spice scents are either too sweet or not mysterious chai spice simplistic - this one surpasses most pitfalls. The only element that I feel Sotoor might be missing is an earthy leather or agarwood note in the base -  but overall this is an excellent big spice bomb. ",

			"content": "As noted by the brand, Jones Beach is a fragrant representation of sand, surf, sunshine, bare skin and bare feet. In this reviewer's opinion, Bond No. 9 has remarkably and very successfully achieved its goal.\n\r\nLike the similar (but noticeably different) Fire Island, Jones Beach conjures up coastal breezes, salty air and most cleverly the lightly sweet musky scent of skin that has been in the sun. Where Fire Island goes heavily for a just applied 'sunscreen on skin' vibe, I think Jones Beach instead opts for how your skin might smell at the end of a day at the beach. That is, once your sunscreen has mostly worn off.\n\r\nLooking at the brand's published notes, aside from the white musk, you would not expect a combination of Calone, Orange Flower Absolute, Ambrox & Violet to achieve such a clear representation of skin that is not shower fresh clean, but not dirty either. It's the smell of skin that has been in and out of salt water and since dried in the sun. Although not listed as a note, I swear that I detect a small amount of tuberose here as well.\n\r\nAs I have come to expect from Bond No. 9, the performance is outstanding. On my skin it lasts an entire work day and I can still clearly smell it when I'm changing out of my work clothes at the end of the day. I've now worn this several times to work and out on the weekends and at least a few of my friends and colleagues have commented positively about how nice it smelt. It's not nearly as powerful as Fire Island, but that OK with me. I think that Jones Beach is meant to be a more understated fragrance. \n\r\nThis is a very fun, relaxed and not too serious offering from Bond No. 9 and it gets 2 thumbs way up and 5 stars from me.",

I ordered a sampler along with two sets of his Studio Series, which include sketches of things he\u2019s working on or materials he\u2019s interested in. The four scents of Chris\u2019s main collection are all very good, though none captivated me as much as two of these sketches\u2014the Chypre project (which, if it ever comes out, promises to be glorious), and the Wood/Yuzu project.\n\r\nTimbre is said to be the \u201cfirst\u201d perfume to come out of his Wood/Yuzu sketches (and let\u2019s hope there are more). It\u2019s bracingly fresh\u2014petitgrain, bitter yuzu, and juicy orange\u2014tempered by a light cedar and sparkling mineral notes. He added a small amount of oud sometime after the last sketch I smelled, and it\u2019s the better for it\u2014just enough to give the blend a deeper and darker edge without overpowering. I\u2019m not a citrus or cologne lover, but this one is perfect. It\u2019s not butch, nor astringent, just well-balanced and fresh. Chris says it\u2019s designed to be worn by the end of the summer so that the top notes remain pure, but I could see this working during any season, for any reason. It\u2019s a limited edition, but as I write this in July 2019, the last bottles still remain. There\u2019s hope for you.\n\r\nIt bears a resemblance to Comme des Gar\u00e7ons x Artek\u2019s Standard (a perfume I have long had and loved). Where that one feels to excel in the chill of Scandinavian Modern, Timbre has more grain, more nuance, more hand. It\u2019s exceptional.",

Its name is appropriate, as it\u2019s a fresh salty, semi-aquatic, semi-fruity fragrance with fig and woods adding a little bit of heft to the salt water opening. And even though like most inexpensive fragrances, much of the pizzazz and loud projection is in the opening minutes\u2014maybe half-hour\u2014Sea Salt & Fig retains a reasonable density, albeit at a fairly modest projection, for hours thereafter.

It\u2019s not particularly dressed-up or serious, but that\u2019s hardly what it\u2019s meant or good for. It simply strikes me as offering something that most designer cheapies or offerings at Bath and Body Works or The Body Shop don\u2019t: a fresh and semi-fruity creation that feels well-put-together and performs decently well.

And yet, there is something clearly lab-made about the scent; it feels engineered, ergonomic, and therefore a bit more chic or more modern than just a simple clustering of naturals.\n\r\nI\u2019m in love with how this (really quite simple) scent of white, clean, salty woods and musk gives me that \u2018my-skin-but-better\u2019 aura; it\u2019s effortless and sensual. I\u2019m willing to bet serious money that people who love those modern, shape-shifting floral-woody musks made to smell like 50% cyborg, 50% warm human skin \u2013 stuff like Glossier You, Diptyque\u2019s Fleur de Peau, and Le Labo Ambrette 9 \u2013 will love Salted Green Mango. For me, it knocks all those modern skin musks, as well as Jo Malone\u2019s (really excellent) Wood Sage & Sea Salt, right off their perches. This one goes straight on the full bottle list.   ",

But they are tempered with a sort of over-ripe dirty quality. As if the fruit fell off a tree and was rotting for a couple days, which gives it this almost animalic musky thread. The fragrance turns tart and green. I get a hint of saltiness, but not as much as others. I have one fragrance. Profumo e Gusto in Libert\u00e0 : CAaastagna_saalaaata by Hilde Soliani Profumi, which is salty and seasoned like the Mediterranean ocean. I don't find this to be nearly as salty as CAaastagna. Other samplers get more salt than fruit. Overall, I get more fruit than salt. But it maintains a gritty undertow and that sharp green accord, which avoids being like a shower gel. I have applied one extra spritz than usual for me, on average - 5 sprays instead of 4 and with that application I am finding very good longevity and decent silage.",

The SM in SM Caf\u00e9 stands for sado-masochism, but there\u2019s nothing really risqu\u00e9 about this nicely-balanced dance between the intense, burnt flavor of freshly-roasted coffee beans and the clean sweetness of wood, musks, and amber resin. The coffee does smell undeniably dirty and grungy, but it\u2019s more the funk of damp coffee grounds you\u2019re cleaning out of the pot than anything S&M or leather related, and anyway it all gets balanced out by the milky ambers and beeswax in the base.\n\r\nAlthough not terribly fruity, the sour morello cherry accent and the coumarin add a certain pipe tobacco angle to the concoction that I find broadly handsome \u2013 it also makes SM Caf\u00e9 the indie synonym for Close Up by Olfactive Studio. But truth be told, SM Caf\u00e9 is far more austere and masculine-leaning; in overall orientation, far closer to the dusty, burnt, 1970s character of Coze by Parfumerie Generale than to the sweetened coffee-tobacco of Close Up.

			"content": "Ottoman Empire II is primarily an oud fragrance with leathery-musky nuances. The rose is there initially, but somewhat behind a veil. The oud isn't medicinal, cheesy, barnyard-y or animalic; it's rather woody-leathery earlier on, and a few hours later leathery-musky. If one has to dissect then there are floral elements, but overall it isn't particularly floral to my nose. To my nose, this is a somewhat linear fragrance. It does show development, but that is sort of the oud revealing its different facets, rather than some conventional transition from opening to base as one finds in classical perfumery. There are a lot of listed notes, but on my skin there is minimal separation of notes. All I smell is the central oud accord from start to finish. It has good presence on skin, and goes on for several hours; some might find the initial/mid phases a bit sharp (though not synthetic-sharp), while the dry down is soft and just a little sensuous, but not engaging or memorable to me. \n\r\nThe schtick is strong with Areej Le Dore fragrances, and they tend to hit you before you smell the fragrance. This is a brand that highlights its usage of high-quality and rare naturals. While this could be the case (this one certainly does smell like it has a good quality oud oil), the issue is that the final compositions lack polish and refinement, and do not smell particularly appealing. I've had a similar experience with the original Siberian Musk, which was a more nuanced composition but at the same time identically lacking. These aren't cut from the same cloth as something like Amouage Tribute, for example, and aren't as polished/refined as the better examples of mainstream western perfumes. \n\r\nA separate issue as a consumer is that these perfumes are created in limited numbers (for whatever reasons) and that drives up prices through speculation, not to mention creating echo-chambers of fanboys. Even if I ignore all of that as background noise, I find these to be a hard-buy given that these are structurally in the middle ground between western perfumery and middle-eastern attars and oils, but lack the best features of either. \n\n\r\n2.5/5",

			"content": "Wearing Community is an unexpectedly nostalgic experience for me, because its first 3 hours smells very reminiscent of a cucumber facial wash cream that I used during my teenage years. It's probably the kind of dewy, aqueous, almost crystalline aspect of melon minus its juicy sweetness, combined with a subtle, ivory soap-like silky creamy undertone, that creates this association to me. \n\r\nAs this \"cucumber facial wash\" vibe gradually fades, a slightly spicy grassy note emerges, which is quite similar to how I perceive cis-3-hexenol, the main fragrant component of freshly cut grass. I, like many people, find the smell of freshly mown lawn invigorating when I catch whiffs of it by the wind. But it often appears quite harsh and overpowering to me in a perfume, because I'm more or less trapped in its range for hours, which is unfortunately the case with Community too. \n\r\nLuckily, a tender, slightly melon-y but mostly abstract fruity sweetness soothes the brash grassy note with time. And softly resinous and grassy labdanum also peeks out from time to time in the dry down to anchor the fragrance without weighing it down. I also occasionally catch a faint whiff of a bitter and salty herbalness, but it's not concrete or strong enough to evoke any particular note to me. The sillage is mostly moderate during its 7 hours wear on me.\n\r\nBecause of its \"cucumber facial wash\" nostalgic factor, I was quite amused when sampling Community. The subtle warming labdanum in its far dry down is also a wonderful touch to anchor a fresh grassy perfume instead of the more clich\u00e9 route of mainly relying on soapy white musk. However, it still doesn't overcome the harsh feeling of many grassy perfumes that rely on cis-3-Hexenol or similar components in my opinion. Overall, I'd say Community does its job as a conventional fresh perfumes in the Niche market, as long as one is not too sensitive to those grass-imitating aromachemicals.",

			"content": "Now this one is very nice indeed and I have been enjoying wearing it this fine day. It opens soft and spicy with pink pepper and saffron with a touch of freshness from the bergamot. Soon after the rose develops and this accord is the star of the show, it's a really lovely bright slightly creamy pink rose. Now in a lot of scents of this type the rose can be very strong and can drown out the other notes. Not so here, the lush rose (and it's lovely) flows and ebbs like the tides of the ocean out of the gentle soft spiciness. So every so often a aroma of a beautiful bright and slightly creamy rose just caresses your senses only to return to the rosy soft spiciness.\n\r\nNow this is what I really like about this scent is that it is really well balanced making it very wearable. The star of the show rose never overwhelms or drowns out the other notes. After three hours and into the basenotes you are left with a very nice rosy soft spiciness that reminds me a little bit of Ambre Nuit but without the powder and with a better rose note. \n\r\nNow onto the so called Oud, it's basically not here and I think I would be shocked if it was from Dunhill. Now I don't know the mind of the creator but I am going to try and guess what she was going for with this note. Now with real oud you would get a cheesy barnyard aroma and then when that dies down you get a creamyness from the Oud that mixes in with the rose. In real Oud and rose combos the use of real oud adds depth to the scent and rounds out the rose accord into something lush smelling.\n\r\nNow here in the basenotes I can smell the slightly creamy effect with the rose, not as great as the real thing but it's there. Of course the animalic aspect has not been replicated, again not with Dunhill. So this is my guess that the creamy aspect with the rose is the creators way of replicating the effect of Oud on the rose.\n\r\nNow the price for what you get is expensive as you can get the same quality for half price ie Royal Potion Black to name one. But all in all it's very lovely and I like it a lot.\n\r\nOn a side-note when all the above notes are spent and in the far dry-down there is this annoying jelly-baby candy accord. It's the same accord that is in Indian Sandalwood and British leather. It persists through showers and is just weird and annoying to have this accord running through most of the scents from this exclusive range.",

I of course had to try both and compare and contrast. Hence, this review will appear on both pages in Basenotes.\n\r\nThe web site Perfume Shrine tells us that the name Plumeria comes from 17th century French botanist Charles Plumier, who studied the plant, and the common name, Frangipani, is derived from a patrician Italian family of the 12th century, an ancestor of which created the art of scenting leather gloves (jasmine, musk, civet), which became the rage when Marie de Medici brought the fashion to the French court in the 16th century. It became famous in Hindu and Buddhist culture as an incense for use in temple worship. Polynesian women wear blossoms behind ears, indicating whether they are single or married.\n\r\nDescribed as a cross between \u201cbuttery and citrusy,\u201d there are a number of scents out there using \u201cFrangipani\u201d as part of its name. A number of their note trees, however, use jasmine as a substitute for the flower, which is an entirely different scent.\n\r\nNow, to the test. The BF Frangipani is sweet with a slight green undernote, similar to that found in pure jasmine oil, although there is no real similarity between Frangipani and Jasmine to my nose. The resemblance to the scents of such white florals as gardenia, tuberose and certain lilies is apparent. Despite the sweetness, it is dry and light, not cloying. My spouse detects a slight cinnamon accord, which for him, warms the scent.\n\r\nThe BF Plumeria is entirely different, opening with a strong blast of mint, developing into a chocolate/coconut accord. It is like inhaling a Peter Paul Mounds candy bar. As such, it begins as a gourmand. As it develops it becomes thicker, more syrupy, but still retains that chocolate/coconut accord. A bit of mimosa stealthily enters. It is obviously quite delicious.\n\r\nSo, night and day. I questioned BF perfumer, Mary Behlar, about her two different takes on the same plant. She informed me that BF derives these from two different oil suppliers and that each has a loyal client base, hence the retention of the two different names. This is further justified by the olfactory fact that they smell entirely different from one another.\n\r\nBoth scents are lovely. Definitely for divided tastes.\n\n\n",

Perfumers have either gone the route of presenting it just as it is, which can cause problems due to its intensity re wearing on the skin, or, like Coty and Caswell Massey, mixed it with powdery, vanillic elements to make it eminently wearable.\n\r\nBourbon French manages the seemingly impossible, presenting a true scent, but minus the sharp, often harsh, effect of smelling the flowers themselves. This is a securely feminine scent. No man I know of could pull off wearing this. It is, however, a matronly scent, not something I would recommend for young women. There is the hint of life experience in Lily of the Valley\u2019s combination of sweetness and strength.\n\r\nAnother very successful soliflore achievement from this distinguished New Orleans House.\n",

Of the almost 60 scents listed on Basenotes containing the name, very very few actually smell like the flower itself. Tuvache has come closest in the world of commercial perfumery to attain a true mimosa.\n\r\nMimosa is a unique scent among flowers, difficult to describe as it is not \u201clike\u201d any other in my life experience. It has a musky, vanillic vibe that is warm and comforting. The Bourbon French take on Mimosa opens with a strong blast of mint, which lasts for some time.  As it calms down, the true scent of the Mimosa flower slowly unfurls.\n\r\nAs such it can be surprise upon first experiencing and without giving it the time it needs to emerge, can create a negative reaction, so do be patient.  This is an excellent mimosa soliflore and to be recommended to everyone, like myself, in love with this amazing scent.\n",

			"content": "Bourbon French \u2013 Sweet Olive\n\r\nWikipedia tells us that the Sweet Olive is native to Asia, is the \u201ccity flower\u201d of China, and is prevalent from the Himalayas to Taiwan, Japan, Cambodia and Thailand. It is known to the world of perfumery as \u201cosmanthus.\u201d It is used as a food and tea flavoring in the orient as well. The traditional take on its scent is that of peach and/or apricot.\n\r\nCurrently there are 29 scents listed in Basenotes bearing the name \u201cosmanthus,\u201d and 4 bearing the name of \u201csweet olive\u201d or \u201ctea olive,\u201d its other moniker. The earliest of the \u201cosmanthus\u201d scents bears a date of only 2003, while the \u201csweet olive\u201d and \u201ctea olive\u201d have been part of the scent line-up of Hove and Bourbon French Parfums, both located in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, for respectively 90 and 120 years, or thereabouts. It has been a staple in gardens of the American South for two centuries.\n\r\nOsmanthus has been part of the note trees of dozens of the scents I have reviewed on Basenotes, but I have never encountered it on its own. The Bourbon French presentation of their Sweet Olive is captivating to say the least. It is quite strong, both sweet and bitter at the same time, with (to my nose) hints of vanilla, coconut, and leather, as well as the buttery peach/apricot vibe. It is exciting for this jaded nose to experience a soliflore for the first time, and to find it to be a unique and positive experience.\n\r\nIt is a scent that can be quite unisex. Best for day wear under any circumstance and fine for the work place. A truly delightful find. Bravo Bourbon French Parfums.\n",

Usually this process uses tuberose as its base and includes jasmine and various lily oils.\n\r\nHowever, Bourbon French has a much truer Gardenia than is found in most parfumer\u2019s repertoires. It is not tuberose dominant and smells much closer to the actual Gardenia flower. It has a noble, but subdued, sweetness, which reminds me of Ylang Ylang. Here is the waxiness and voluptuousness of Gardenia without any cloying effect.\n\r\nIt is quite a surprise and becomes for me the preferred choice in the contest of Gardenia soliflores.\n\n\n",

If you recall a soft candy of the 20th century in the shape of a peanut with the scent of banana, company name Spangler, then you have an approximation of the over-all effect here.\n\r\nIf I ever actually inhale the aroma of a White Ginger Lily, I will edit this review, comparing the Bourbon French creation to the real thing. Until then, I can at least recommend this lovely soliflore as a beautiful and exotic floral.\n",

Perhaps the most famous of the group is Piguet\u2019s Fracas with its luscious tuberose and peach.\n\r\nBy keeping it simple, BF gives us a delightfully light take on the true notes of both the rose and the peach, making this a fun experience. Romanov is certainly feminine, but a man could pull it off if lightly applied. Perfect for office wear and for summer evening events.\n\r\nRemarkably affordable, as are all parfums from this house, and worth your taking a chance.\n",

This, as is always the case in my experience with BF, is quite accurate.\n\r\nA delightfully old-fashioned (in a good sense) parfum with all the richness of a ladies\u2019 scent from the 1930s or 1940s. Superbly blended florals so seamless that I can\u2019t pick out a single one, mixed with what seem to be plum and peach, float over a touch of cinnamon and that serious musk.  This seems to be ideal for a formal evening out, dinner followed by opera or theater. It cries out for furs \u2013 Garbo in Wild Orchids \u2013 and is for me a very palpable hit.\n\r\nFirst edit: As I live with this scent I am reminded of Corday's Possession with its buttery central note of gentian violet.  Very similar.\n\r\nBourbon French Parfums is a true find for the vintage lover. Superbly blended oils with over 70 creations, 15 for the gentleman, nearly 30 soliflores, and as many house creations.

All BP\u2019s web site will tell us is that it is a combination of woods and spices with an emphasis on a cinnamon note.\n\r\nRight away one gets a whiff of old-fashioned elegance in the blending, reminding me of the Lanvins of that era. The balance is so perfect that with the exception of the cinnamon, I cannot really detect individual notes, though sandalwood and cedar must certainly have a presence, cedar having the ability to support and lift cinnamon. There is also a very subtle rose at its heart. It is warm and sensual, and quite sophisticated.\n\r\nThis strikes me as a scent for the mature woman and for formal occasions, such as theatre, opera and social gatherings.\n\r\nAnyone into vintage parfums from this era owes it to oneself to give Tonight a try. It is amazing to have something of this quality still available to twenty-first century noses.\n",

			"content": "Bourbon French \u2013 ENTRE NOUS\n\r\nImmortelle (the Everlasting Flower) is here treated as a soliflore. I also detect some vanilla, as in  a wafer cookie, but it is the Immortelle that is center stage. This intriguing scent has the effect of dark maple syrup mixed with celery seed, making it very much a gourmand. Bourbon French hints that it contains citrus and spice, but I cannot detect any such notes. Immortelle is a dark note, effectively worn in the Autumn.\n\r\nNow, I used to be a great fan of this scent, when I first discovered it, as it is so appealing to the olfactory senses in that gourmand way (crepes with butter and syrup make my mouth water), but repeated use has not sustained it over time. It seemingly was a one-time sensation that I quickly grew tired of. It is however quite favored in the perfume world, the 1985 Goutal Sables being the first time it was given the spotlight in a modern creation (it is present in many less famous older scents).\n\r\nSo, if immortelle is your thing, this is the most economical way to purchase it, since Bourbon French prices are extremely affordable. The quality is just as high as with the Goutal at a fraction of the cost.\n",

			"content": "Oh, the cheekiness to create such a decadent symphonic ornament in the 21st century. I find its powdered effusive smooth mimosa opulence irresistible. It has a unique floral accord I\u2019m beguiled by. Though it\u2019s made in Australia, the ethos is pure grand old-school French. I enjoy reveling in its opulent personality.\n\r\nThe Australian mimosa (Wattle) is the heart of this fragrance, supported by orange blossom and jasmine that work admirably. And, there\u2019s no rose, which is usually like leaving something out. But it\u2019s so satisfying here. This makes a difference, and I find myself smelling it often on my arm just to kind of take it in. There\u2019s kind of a subliminal rusticness to the wattle and doesn\u2019t need rose to dress it up with those damascones.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a luxurious oriental with spicy elements adding zest to the warm yellow tones, but it\u2019s by no means a spicy fragrance -  they increase its solar character. Velvet Splendour reminds me of the ethos of the MDCI perfume line of baubles, and think it would be at home there. \n\r\nIn the heart, a burnish of leather appears on the golden petals, but it\u2019s not a leather fragrance. It deepens Velvet Splendour a bit, and finds a certain resonance with the floral notes, a light-handed suntan of a leather note. The drydown doesn\u2019t get darker or stray from it\u2019s linear opulent idea. Long-lasting.\n\r\nThough I\u2019m quite fascinated by it, and love the semi-rustic floral accord at its heart, I\u2019m having a hard time imagining where I could wear it. You need to have some cheeky charm to pull it off well, other than haunting the theater. But I may need to try and find a decant, just so I can have it around. Worth sampling just for its unique floral personality. A quintessential elevator bomb and to have entire sections of the movie house to yourself.\n",

Yes, I have totally fallen in love with L'Eau Gothique and will soon be purchasing my first full bottle!\n\r\nThe Reims website says...with L'Eau Gothique, \"Duchaufour revisits his earlier masterpiece Avignon but captures the splendor of High Mass incense by way of an altogether warmer, spicier, and woodier route, effectively giving the scent a \u2018human\u2019 tone that\u2019s missing in the Comme des Garcons scent.\"  And while I'm not able to completely recall my experience with Avignon (I wasn't a fan), I am beyond certain this fragrance is much warmer and woodsier, less harsh and rough, friendlier, more appealing and much more wearable than Avignon (or practically all of the Commes des Garcons Parfum Series 3 fragrances).\n\r\nL'Eau Gothique definitely opens with a whack of bergamot, coriander & spice...I imagine for some this could be sneeze inducing!  However within minutes, frankincense notes pleasantly emerge...primarily resinous balsam & pine...quickly blending with the coriander & citrus opening.  Shortly thereafter, beautiful & fragrant floral notes break through and seamlessly blend with the spicier and more balsamic opening notes. Twenty-to-thirty minutes in, this fragrance pleasantly expands even further introducing smooth & gentle patchouli incense notes.  With this, the balsamic scent fades backstage only intermittently appearing throughout the next several hours.  Overall, the coriander and citrus are gone.\n\r\nThis beautiful fragrance is subtle, soothing, calming and warm.  Musky, resinous, slightly balsamic & woodsy notes re-emerge and mingle with lovely florals & patchouli throughout the wear.  At times, the dry-down is slightly powdery, yet not overwhelmingly so (like what one might encounter with many Serge Lutens perfumes).  L'Eau Gothique is a beautiful, non-mainstream, highly wearable fragrance.  And while this fragrance is not overly complex, it certainly is not simple, linear, or boring.  I would say L'Eau Gothique is definitely a \"niche\" fragrance and not one for the masses.\n\r\nOn me, L'Eau Gothique seemed almost meditative.  Silage was mild-to-moderate and longevity was moderate-to-good.  I doubt you will smell anything even close to this fragrance at your local department store perfume counter...no way. \n\r\nAnd at approximately $180 for a 100 ml bottle, L'Eau Gothique is a bargain.  If you are a lover of gentle, feminine leaning, patchouli, frankincense, floral incense fragrances, please go ahead and give L'Eau Gothique a try!  I do not think you will be disappointed.\n",

			"content": "I describe Monbloom by Ramon Monegal (2016) as a \"monster floral\" because it falls just short of being a powerhouse due to the lack of aldehyde sparkle or heavy animalics, but has an overwhelmingly thick and rich composition nonetheless, making it something other than the usual watery things you see coming from designers. The female target audience for Monbloom is still likely to find favor in it due to that cleaner and more modern makeup, but it has sufficient strength to maybe please older women used to heavier perfume as well. As man that plays with perfume from all gender spectrums, I can appreciate what Ramon has done here, but the kind of path Monbloom treads is one that still alienates me as it simply smothers in shampoo-like galaxolide sweetness and that isn't a tone I really enjoy. That being said, there is nothing cheap or rough about the composition, and like most Monegal creations, merges natural and synthetic materials into a heady overly-blended whole that smoulders intensely on skin. \n\r\nThe opening of Monbloom is a big slug of tuberose, with fleshy qualities that impart an 80's flair despite lacking the billowing aldehyde swoosh. From there, we get sweet and clean orange blossom wrestling with ylang-ylang to round out the top. Indolic jasmine plays a huge part in the heart, countering the effects of the orange blossom and ylang slightly but also adding thickness to the body of the scent alongside osmanthus, which provides the core apricot-like fruity sweetness of Monbloom. This is the part where I start to tune out, since patchouli, labdanum, white musk, and synthetic woody notes posing as oud and cedar take this home, but fans of heavy sweet florals would enjoy Monbloom just fine. As the name suggests, this blooms off skin all day with medium projection but intense sillage that could border on cloying if overused. I see this as a date night scent but those in love with this kind of thing can wear it pretty much whenever. Cooler weather is better for Monbloom but once more, this can be a year-rounder for those who love sweet florals and clean but heavy woody/musky bases but you have both a fat tuberose and osmanthus note to contend with from start to finish.\n\r\nMonbloom is part of the white series, which focuses on florals and mostly lighter feminine-marketed selections, so the way this turned out comes as no surprise to me, but this is really well done despite the droll style. My problem with Monbloom is it takes the redolent blended vibe that Ramon Monegal favors, which is in essence a slightly down-market but still niche-quality variation of what Roja Dove enjoys, and applies it to a pedestrian and tired genre of commercial fruity floral/fruitchouli perfumes typically the realm of your cheaper Coty body sprays littering pharmacies. The result of this is something that comes across like a gourmet cheeseburger made with the finest combination of rare meats, breads, cheeses, and salad but still tasting like what you can get from a burger chain on a good day. However, you may disagree if this kind of floral is your vibe, and therefore I encourage sampling before taking my word. I can respect this, but not enjoy it, so thumbs up is impossible.

			"content": "English Laundry 'London' smells about 85% similar to Creed 'Aventus' on its dry down, and would be a legendary fragrance all on its own if the performance matched the rest of the English Laundry line. With a liberal ten or more sprays (neck, chest, shoulders and wrists), longevity is still only about four hours, with most of that life spent close to the skin.\n\r\nIt does last about 5-7+ hours on clothing and fabrics, so spraying over clothes is a must. Projection is ok for the first fifteen to thirty minutes, but then it dries down dramatically fast after that. Sillage is very soft as well. Someone has to be right on you or hugging you to smell this scent, but when they do they will enjoy it. If 'Aventus' made an Eau de Cologne or really an Eau Fraiche concentration flanker, this would be it. It says Eau de Parfum on the label but if so this is the weakest EDP I've ever come across.\n\r\nFor the price, you can buy at least a dozen bottles of this at discounters for the price of one 100ml bottle of Creed's 'Aventus', so in that respect, it's definitely a good value. You can go crazy on the trigger and not worry about the price. I have 'Club de Nuit Intense' and 'L'Aventure', which both are about 99% and 95% repectively similar to Creed 'Aventus' with better performance than 'Aventus' in my testings. I would actually suggest buying those two and this fragrance for the following reason.\n\r\n'Club de Nuit Intense' is the strongest by far and perfect for a night out clubbing or barhopping. 'L'Aventure' is a bit lighter but still has great performance, so its more suited for daytime events and being outdoors. English Laundry's 'London' is very toned down and subtle, so its better suited for being indoors in an intimate setting like a Netflix and cuddle evening or before bed with your lady where you don't necessarily want or need strong sillage or projection. It that setting, this scent is perfect and has the right amount of sillage for the situation where the other two would be too strong and aggressive on the nose.\n\r\nAll three of the above mentioned fragrances can be picked up for less than $100 for all three, which is still less than half the price for a 100ml bottle of Creed 'Aventus' and its 'batch issues'. For the price that Creed selections go for, you shouldn't have those issues and performance should be a beastly 15+ hours, but sadly its not. Hence, why the clones are gaining in popularity.\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this on its own if you're looking for a good 'Aventus' clone. But if you own 'Club de Nuit Intense' and 'L'Aventure' already, this might be a nice addition for wearing in the right setting. It smells absolutely amazing once it dries down and settles, but the huge problem is that moment lasts less than an hour before its a skin scent and then its completely gone a couple hours later. Still, definitely recommended if you can pick it up cheap as a bedtime intimacy or cuddle fragrance and you love the scent character of Creed 'Aventus'.",

			"content": "It was only a matter of time before English Laundry tackled a fragrance that smells like Creed Aventus (2010), and that's because English Laundry as a house seeks to democratize the British/UK luxury male fashion aesthetic for the US and other audiences abroad, so taking a shot at the leading masculine perfume from one of the most popular luxury perfumers sold in the UK with claimed ties to English nobility (despite being French) is a no-brainer. Indeed, Creed Aventus is one of the most-worn fragrances among the affluent upper-classes of London, after which English Laundry names its \"clone\", but like all homages to popular styles coming from a designer couture house rather than a deliberate \"clone\" perfumer, English Laundry London (2018) seeks to sell itself as something other than a copycat. Unfortunately, this is simply impossible when dealing with fragrances that either reference or take any inspiration from Creed Aventus in even the slightest form, because the fan base for the stuff is so obsessive, so pedantic, so foaming-at-the-mouth to defend the honor of their gentrified bro-culture validation sauce that anything bearing resemblance is descended upon, being ripped to shreds instantly. Nobody really cared when Creed Green Irish Tweed (1985) was democratized (by its own perfumer) as Davidoff Cool Water (1988), although comparisons would eventually turn to bitter arguments after the invention of the internet allowed \"cologne guys\" to discuss their interests. So here we have English Laundry London, the first proper designer fragrance to take a stab at the DNA of Creed Aventus, and although it would be completely overshadowed by the higher-profile and more-unique Montblanc Explorer (2019), it's something of a marvel on its own. For starters, the smell of London is not a play-by-play doppelganger of Creed Aventus like a true clone such as Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Man (2015), because the house has always done \"luxury\" takes on popular designer accords by buttressing several together or adding a unique spin to a singular popular style, then smoothing the Hell out of it so the chemical seams don't show like they would in the designer being plagiarized.\n\r\nThis method immitation-meets-innovation has taken the house far in the eyes of the fragrance community as a good value-for-dollar alternative to designers, since they're basically applying a niche sense of quality to a mass-appeal fragrance, but since a niche perfume with considerable pride of ownership/status is being tackled by good ol' Chrisopher Wicks, I'm not sure this method will be appreciated by hobbyists with London. The opening of English Laundry London is as you might expect, coming across the nose with a whole lot of citrus, pineapple, green apple and other fruitiness. English Laundry switches out the blackcurrant of Aventus for blackberry, but it makes no difference in the end because you still end up with the same sweet, completely safe, and played-out citrus/fruit one-two-punch. I think the veteran Creed fan will pick out the difference right away and recuse any arguments of direct clone intention, but the general \"frag-bro\" will still cry fowl. From there, we get a heart of jasmine hedione, denatured patchouli heart, and birch like Aventus, providing a bit of the smokiness Aventus is famous for, but adding a gin-inflected touch with juniper in place of rose. This juniper gives a slight presage to Maison Francis Kurkdjian's Gentle Fluidity [Silver] (2019), and is the unique twist English Laundry places on the heart. It's clear after about 30 minutes on skin that London has no intention to dry down exactly like Aventus does, even though ambroxan/ambergris, white musk, and vanilla are key players in the base, since the oakmoss note is a bit more prominent in London and the musk vibe gets closer to that of Creed Royal Mayfair (2015) than in Aventus. I think this is the key difference between London and Aventus: the serious English austerity tone of Royal Mayfair was tapped for the creation of English Laundry London, with the knobs tweaked just a bit to that end, even though the principle ingredients are evidently almost note-for-note with Aventus. A more-British and less-booming take on the style is what London brings to the table, with a floral print shirt and petticoat reminiscent of the UK Mod style English Laundry proselytizes to US buyers of the brand replacing the bespoke tailored suits and wingtip shoes vibe Creed channels through their masculine offerings to the would-be customer. Performance is actually rather on the poor side compared to other English Laundry fragrances, with 7 hours pushing it and projection dropping to skin levels after only 3. The genuine article still has most knock-offs or inspired-by scents beat in that department unless you want the nuclear-strength of the Armaf, but English Laundry London isn't terrible, just not useful much beyond the sedate setting of the office. Weather-wise this is pretty much year-round except maybe not for the harshest extremes of hot and cold, in which other things more-specialized may better serve.\n\r\nIf English Laundry was a clone house from the Middle East, or some \"attempting to improve upon the original\" dupe brand like Dua, Alexandria Fragrances, or Pineapple Vintage, we'd have a whole different story on our hands. But as fate would have it, this is a brand that from tip to tail exists to romanticize past fashions of a specific culture, packaging their concept of luxury into manufactured ready-to-wear and fragrances that merge the catch-all mindset of a designer with the air of exclusivity their source material suggests but at value pricing, so seeing English Laundry ride closely parallel to an upscale brand like Creed doesn't feel disingenuous. What I feel instead from English Laundry is more of a \"what took you so long?\" kind of emotional energy, as the house has been playing mad scientist by combining or embellishing popular designer tropes for years, making mashups of YSL, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Chanel, Dior, Viktor & Rolf, Tom Ford, and Burberry since their inception. If you're genuinely trying to be the Kia or Hyundai of the luxury niche perfume world, you have to eventually step up to the plate and start smelling like the \"big boys\", not copying the stuff just slightly above you in price that people interested in upscale perfumes are trying to avoid. I'm not saying English Laundry London is great, and I certainly don't think it is the credible designer answer to Creed that Montblanc Explorer is, but it is the first successful dry run of doing this style well and inexpensively without feeling dishonest. In other words, English Laundry London is the first fragrance of its type that makes you question the price tag of Creed Aventus, because outside a bit of projection loss, they compare favorably to each other in quality. I don't need something like this in my wardrobe, but for fans of the smell but not the price of Aventus, it fits a purpose. English Laundry London makes me excited for what the brand might tackle next, although with the caveat that if they head too far into niche styles, they may lose their intended audience for these fragrances in the first place. Thumbs up. ",

A cool mint would best describe it something that is similarly present vapor rub. One mentioned it as smelling like menthol. At this time the tuberose florals began to intensify along with the jasmine grandiflorum. I have to say that the florals were a bit stuffy at times, its carried a strong punch. Letting my nose adjust, I was able to pick up some of the underlying fruit notes which was probably the contributions from both the osmmanthus and red currant. That likely held the florals in check. As time progressed the monstrous florals settled down to what was a dark leather base. Very strong longevity and silage. Overall it was a very challenging scent one that wasn\u2019t exactly easy to wear. I\u2019d say Flos Mortis caters to a very specific group of individuals with myself not being one of them.",

I don't read it as tuberose either, & I see that tuberose isn't even listed among the notes here in the Directory. The redcurrant isn't obvious, but seems to lend a fruity sweetness to the mix. Five minutes in, the mothball accord strengthens, & dominates for the next two hours before receding. After this, osmanthus adds another, more creamy note of fruitiness, still going softly seven hours in.  \r\nDisconcertingly, the remnant of this that remains on the sleeve of my robe the next morning has an insidious, sickly sweetness that puts me in mind of rotting teeth. Perhaps that's where the \"morbidity\" comes in, but other than that, I'm left wondering what all the fuss is about. There is a vaguely gothic feel to this, & I'm sure anyone who enjoys Tubereuse Criminelle would love it, but it's far too sweet for me, & there's nothing morbid about the pretty coral pink colour of that juice!",

There\u2019s two fragrances that came to mind: Orange Spice and Cypres Musc. The citrus accord in Orange Spice does seem similar to the one in 40 Love. The soapy accord in Cypres Musc does seem similar to the one in 40 Love. Ironically they were all fragrances from the same era, 40 Love (1947/1951), Orange Spice 1950, and Cypres Musc 1948. Back to the scent, as the opening notes wore off a substantial amount of musk could be detected with an animalic note. At the same instance floral notes began to creep in. What kind of florals they were I wasn\u2019t quite sure. I wanted to say there was a presence of some sort of herbal note present in the scent. Honeysuckle came to mind of all things. There was a tinge of green and powdery feel at the heart of the scent. Finally at the base I\u2019m left with the lingering musk and animalic accord in addition to what I believed were a dusty amber note and smidge of oakmoss. There was decent longevity with moderate silage early on before staying close to the skin for the remainder of the duration.

It\u2019s a dry oud that is pretty darn boastful at the onset (I went easy on the sprays) but dries down rather comfortably to become of a sober take on oud, with some of the familiar accompaniments of saffron, rose, and resins (galbanum, in this case), along with the reliable lavender and few more provocative additives that I don\u2019t detect much of at all, like camphor and civet.\n\r\nIn that I don\u2019t get much of the civet on my skin, Notorious Oud is smooth and not all that dirty.  It does have the spicy, floral, and resinous touches, but it\u2019s mostly smooth oud, just less so than, say, Pure Oud By Kilian.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good performer, surely not Roja-esque in terms of the loudness of the oud, and probably not even analogous to the Kilian offerings, but still robust enough and frankly a bit easier-to-wear because it\u2019s not so over-the-top oud-heavy.  I could see this being a big winner for the house.\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a very nice fragrance, teetering on the edge between a \u201clike\u201d and a \u201clove\u201d for me.  I\u2019m glad that its pricing is at least consistent with the current lineup, at $260/$175 for 100ml/50ml, respectively.. at its usual points of sale (i.e. Luckyscent, Twisted Lily, etc.)., \n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

Whereas White Queen is a nutty, resinous, floral experience, Red Queen is, as I\u2019ve described it a handful of times, like bright rosy champagne, with some common notes to White Queen like raspberry and resins but Red Queen is decidedly brighter, rosier, and fresher, adding blackcurrant and heavier use of Turkish rose absolute, along with bits of geranium and musk. \n\r\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s bright, fresh, and fruity; on the other, it has some other character with incense, pepper, and patchouli.  The whole experience leans toward the fresh, fruity, and rosy, though, so it\u2019s really an apt wear in many situations.  In some ways, Red Queen is the summer to White Queen\u2019s winter, though both are really very versatile with respect to season and occasion.\n\r\nIt performs well, too, as with most of Sarah\u2019s creations, albeit not quite as strongly as White Queen or some others in the collection, but as one of only a couple of 4160 Tuesdays perfumes that I own and would describe as more warm-weather-friendly, it makes sense that it\u2019s not going to be as boastful as, say, Over the Chocolate Shop.  Still, I\u2019m very content with the way it projects for the first couple of hours and lasts thereafter.\n\r\nRed Queen is available at Perfumology at $120 for 50ml, very standard pricing, and I know I\u2019ll need a backup bottle as I\u2019ve already put a significant dent in mine several months into owning it.  I\u2019d highly recommend fashioning a sample if you\u2019ve not yet tried it.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

So it is no surprise that Priv\u00e9 is a well-mannered creation that sparkles quietly \u2013 its opening emanation of citrus tones elevated beyond the merely lime-and-lemony to a kind of filtered sunlit rendition of mandarin peels and things too exotic for the plebs to have encountered bring an exalted freshness far removed from the shower product.

Priv\u00e9 seems to be an amalgamation of pretty much every typical OJ note; tea, citrus, dry woods, flowers, iris, vanilla, you name it, it's there.\n\r\nI thoroughly like all of these notes, a lot of which are recognisable from other OJ fragrances. I even like them together; they're well blended, a s per usual and the resulting scent has that dry chiqueness that is Ormonde's signature. The problem is that this seems to be the fragrance where perfumer Geza Schoen has gone overboard with some woody aromachemical or other. I normally very much enjoy the way he uses things like Iso E Super in this line (i.e., restrained, never the focus, but very effective), but in this scent there's some radiant, dry, woody note that just takes over and overpowers all the other notes.\n\r\nMy nose seems particularly sensitive to one or more of the popular woody aroma chemicals (I smell nothing but an incredibly radiant alcohol like note in Sauvage, for example), so I think this is causing the problem here. I suspect for someone who's nose is tuned differently, this could be a fantastic scent",

			"content": "Bloodline, by the American Perfumer boutique, was created by Hans Hendley, a limited edition of 15 of which I was lucky to obtain a bottle before it quickly sold out. \n\r\nIt\u2019s dark, dense, rich, and very satisfying to someone like me that\u2019s a huge fan of the winter pine resin type scents, slightly burnt but mostly a mix of various woody, earthy accords\u2014most of all, pine---though there are cedar, patchouli, and oakmoss in the mix, too.  Labdanum adds to the smoky resin vibe and vanilla provides a sweet base, a point of contrast to the deep, albeit slightly sharp woody dominance.   \n\r\nWith dark juice and extrait concentration, Bloodline unsurprisingly performs outstandingly, with tremendous longevity and density, though slightly less projection at first than the most extreme fragrances (some Slumberhouse offerings like Norne, Jeke, Ore, and Sova, and perhaps a couple of Tom Ford Private Blends like Tobacco Vanille and Amber Absolute come to mind as being slightly louder at the onset).  Still, Bloodline is very strong and one need not apply much to enjoy it thoroughly.\n\r\nA fairly easy comparison in the Hendley catalogue is to Fume, another dark, smoky scent, but while Fume more sharply focuses on the burning campfire accord, Bloodline leans toward more pine resin dominances with vanillic undertones.  Quite different, but related, and I\u2019d always recommend Fume in any case, as it belongs to a similar family that includes Slumberhouse Norne, Dasein Winter Nights, La Curie Incendo, and Profumum Arso, all of which I love.\n\r\nOverall, Bloodline is outstanding, and worthy of high praise above all else for its quality, belonging in the group of the aforementioned wintery delights.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

Oriental Leather is spicy and fairly well-balanced, and frankly, doesn\u2019t seem to contain all that much leather, at least not in a dominant proportion, to the other spicy notes that really stand out.\n\r\nTo my nose, it\u2019s mainly a blend of lavender, vanilla, benzoin, and some combination of the spicy notes of pimento leaf, coriander seed, leather, aniseed, geranium leaf, cinnamon bark, and to a lesser extent, patchouli.  It\u2019s a healthy note list with lots of variation in the spicy accords, so it\u2019s difficult for me to pin down one or two spices that outshine the rest.  The lavender sticks out most of all, note-wise, as its sharpness and freshness cut through a bit amidst the creamy base of vanilla/benzoin. \n\r\nIt\u2019s predictably spicier at the opening and within a few hours is quite mellow with more of the vanilla and benzoin coming out.  Overall, its performance is strong and it\u2019s a nice, spicy, robust fragrance, surely a little masculine-leaning as particularly with the lavender, it reminds me a little bit of a fougere-type but a lot more cold-weather-leaning than most barbershop scents.\n\r\nI quite like it and while the retail pricing of $295 for 75ml is a bit more than I\u2019d want to pay, personally, for something like this, it\u2019ll likely reach the grey markets at a big discount, which might be more fitting.  Oriental Leather is roughly as daring as the other leather fragrance of the house: it pushes the envelope slightly while not being too unfamiliar.  Oriental Leather might be among the most agreeable in the lot, in fact, as I see it as a pretty workable cold-weather option for most men, albeit stronger than what some men might like.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

The candied orange peel quality of the star ingredient is in fulsome evidence but so is the resinous dryness, a touch of something old and a mite acrid cutting across the scent profile to prevent it from cloying. Even the traditional oriental bulwarks of tonka and vanilla, and the note du jour of honey are handled in such a manner that the treacle pond is avoided. Bengale Rouge is lush and luxurious \u2013 but in an old money kind of way, there\u2019s a discipline to it rather than a throwing together of rich ingredients; this is brocade that seems minutely patterned. For a perfume that is high in naturals \u2013 the nose detects them immediately and the overall feel is thick \u2013 this is quite a feat.  Grows increasingly soft and velvety with time \u2013 the honey note really coming into its own, throwing a soft golden light over the wearer. \r\nIt remains a cold weather perfume for me due to its density; I suspect your appreciation of it may depend on your tolerance for this more laden form of olfactory expression. \n\n",

			"content": "Carolina Herrera Bad Boy (2019) is the masculine counterpart to Good Girl (2016) that nobody really wanted nor expected, and seems to be the basis for Carolina Herrera Kings (2019), which was released before this in the US but was oddly developed afterward. Instead it seems that Latin America and Europe got first dibs on Bad Boy, and much of that may have to do with the redundant nature of both compositions, or just the fact that US male fragrance buyers shy away from campy themed bottles in a post-Avon world where they aren't commonplace anymore. Whatever the reason, Bad Boy is finally a global release nearly a year after it was first spotted, but the good news is those who didn't have access to it haven't really missed out on much. If you've smelled Kings, you already know the dry down of Bad Boy: Just strip away the violet leaf top and spices in the heart, but leave the sweet tonka \"amberwoods\" base alone, and turn the whole compositions towards the youthful side of things. Bad Boy to me reads like a study on \"what works\" to pull the most attention, compliments, and positive interaction from a male-marketed fragrance in the late 2010's market environment, and smells like the homework assignment of a perfumer looking to base their thesis on just that. Bear in mind that doesn't make Bad Boy truly bad, just incomprehensibly average and pleasant. \n\r\nThe opening of Bad Boy is sweet vacuum-distilled bergamot a la Creed Aventus (2010) and most of its children in the 2010's, but more accurately Montblanc Explorer (2019) because that's the quality of ingredients you'll find here. This sweet bergamot is paired with the same airy marine note as Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce Cologne (2002), but thickened up with pink and white peppercorns so it doesn't feel too summery. The clary sage and cashmere woods in the middle of Bad Boy further compare this to Fierce but a rounded bubblegum shower gel sort of vibe also hearkens towards Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013), with more Paco Rabanne comparisons rolling in once the heavy tonka base reminds me of 1 Million (2008). There is a bit of some fractured patchouli molecule here for additional thickness but no cacao as the note pyramids on some sites may state. In the end, this a kinder, gentler, smoother version of the \"universal mall\" accord that permeates most Macy's and Sephora stores, sitting somewhere between clubber and generalist masculine fruity sweet clean and rich. Wear time is about about 8 hours which is average, and projection also sits close to skin with good sillage during those eight hours. This will offend nobody, and you may indeed garner some compliments wearing it, but Bad Boy is a misnomer for such a capitulating fragrance. I'd say you could use this three out of four months in a year, just not in the dead heat of summer, where the sweetness is likely to be cloying.\n\r\nOf course, there's no getting around the bottle of this little number, as it screams \"Shazam\" to me every time I gaze upon it, although some people may liken it instead to The Flash or David Bowie's Aladdin Sane period. Louis Turner (who worked on the original Good Girl) was brought in to work with Quentin Bisch on Bad Boy, and I honestly think that between the two of them, they were concocting how to include the most bullet points from an impossible list of things the bean counters at Carolina Herrera insisted on being in the scent to guarantee \"maximum market penetration\". It's really kind of sick that this is where we are with designer masculine fragrances (and to a lesser extent feminines too), that a perfume is designed not to stand out from a crowd or carve out its own place in the market, but rather to be a mosaic of the most-prolific success stories of the last twenty years combined with the most-trending buzzword notes and accords. The sheer distillation of market research and cost-cutting found in releases like Bad Boy is soul crushing anymore, regardless of how kitschy the bottle shape may be. Still, I can't bring myself to hate Carolina Herrera Bad Boy, as it does nothing wrong, but on the same token just sorta does... nothing. It exists, it smells okay, and is definitely not lightning in a bottle. Neutral. ",

Say what you want about reviewing perfumes, but a resilient heart is one of the major attributes to have if you want to be honest. \n\r\nLanc\u00f4me\u2019s new Id\u00f4le is up to the chopping block (or, rather, we\u2019re going to be subjected to it for the immediate, bleak, future), and it boasts that it is a musky, floral chypre. There\u2019s a whole schtick about the new bottle as well (which I have yet to see in person, I am writing this after trying an official sample), but what matters is the smell. \n\r\nAnd the smell is\u2026not pretty. Lanc\u00f4me says this has Isparta Rose Petal Essence made especially for them, some Centifolia Rose, notes of bergamot, pear and something called a \u201cclean and glow\u201d accord, whatever the hell that may be.  I won\u2019t beat around the bush: this is an extremely synthetic musky affair, that smells of roses for about 15 minutes, then morphs into a sugary jasmine beast one wouldn\u2019t want to be caught in the same neighbourhood as. Then a little metallic pear and so many nuclear-powered laundry musks it\u2019s hard to describe. Needless to say, Pleasures this is not. \n\r\nThis thing obliterated my nose with one spray, I had to go outside just to get a grip on myself. I couldn\u2019t smell anything else for hours, the aroma chemicals here were so overpowering it was almost like having a cold for a while. And this was one spray, each time I tried it. I\u2019d also like to understand why this is called a chypre. There is absolutely nothing here that would even remotely tie it to the genre (already maligned beyond recognition). This is a chypre as much as I am the famous choreographer Mikhail Baryshnikov. \n\r\nNow, on to the really bad news. I have a feeling that, given the way it smells and goes on for hours, the obscene way it\u2019s front-loaded (this is a discussion in of itself) and the advertising campaign featuring Zendaya (why, oh, why?), it will sell like crazy. I give it a couple of months until this replaces La Vie est Belle as the standard perfume for people who don\u2019t care about perfume. \n\r\nOne final note: I will not comment on the marketing thing further than asking you if whether a perfume that looks like a phablet, is washed-out pink and smells like cheap laundry detergent really does \u201cquestion the status quo\u201d, if it really breaks \u201cfree from tradition\u201d and re-defines \u201cthe meaning of succes\u201d for women. How is selling another bland musky floral bomb breaking free from tradition? If this is breaking the status-quo nowadays, what the hell were Bandit, Tabac Blond and countless others in their hey-day? We all need better idols than Id\u00f4le.",

It is based mainly on a pear note, and by now it has established itself as a sweet composition, but not overly cloying on me.

			"content": "I'm either imagining things, or Parfums de Marly is actually making a serious go out of being a niche house almost a decade into its existence. Now I'm not saying it's being a good niche house, but at very least it seems to be trying its hand as of 2018 onward at offering something to the Western market you can't readily get in the mainstream, not counting the mostly Middle East-exclusive oud blends (and we are really kidding ourselves when we say that the concept of oud isn't mainstream). Sedley (2019) is one of two new masculine releases I have seen in major department stores handling the Parfums de Marly brand, with the other one being the peppery-dry Kalan (2019). Sedley isn't exactly groundbreaking, but shows the first sparks of trying to do something that isn't a designer redress amped to 11 since the early days of scents like Lipizzan (2010), Ispazon (2010), and Godolphin (2010), all of which earned the house the niche credibility it has woefully milked through releases like Pegasus (2011), Herod (2012), Byerley (2014), Galloway (2014), and Layton (2016). All told, this is a fresh sort of fragrance, but has a really nice and complex sort of development, on a base that isn't irritatingly over-amplified with aromachems (even if they are still the mainstay of the PdM formulae). \n\r\nThe opening of bergamot, mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, and mint really sort of draws me into some mid to late-2000's fragrances like Cartier Roadster (2008) with its smoothness, and even wisps of Versace Eros (2012), but designer comparisons end there as a host of really robust barbershop herbs and florals enter the equation, conjuring images of more recent Penhaligon's masculine scents but with more heft than anything that house has released outside its oud lines. A rich rosemary and geranium heart note is smoothed by lavender, juniper, and heated up with olibanum, until a thick but moderated semi-oriental base appears. The slow fade from fresh and sweet minty citrus to shave foam then creamy woods is an interesting olfactive jawbreaker of sorts, with layers of increasing intensity until a polysantal/cashmeran foundation appears, cooked up with ambrox super and seasoned with the green robustness of a vetiver/patchouli pair. It's not master perfumery, but Sedley is really competent and not cloying, plus distinctive unlike a lot of stuff you could be buying in the places it's sold. This jack of all trades vibe works in the office, club, or cooler casual days for me, with endless longevity combined with more considerate sillage than normal for the house. This won't blow off anyone's socks, but it does smell better up close than from afar, which is part of the charm.\n\r\nParfums de Marly has come full-circle with this one, although I won't say they've redeemed themselves just yet, because it only takes another wave of releases to place them back in the doldrums of \"upscale designer knockoff\" where they've been since the mid 2010's. Sedley is at least a good step in the right direction alongside the more-controversial Kalan, giving fans of the house a taste of something they haven't had since the beginning, and some doubters of the brand (like me) a few new things to consider. I still wouldn't plunk $300 down for this, but if Sedley showed up somewhere on clearance, I'd be tempted as this scent could fill a particular hole in my olfactive arsenal. This is just a nice and surprisingly \"complete\" masculine perfume full of layers, transitions, and a nice fresh start that only hints at its own complexity. I'd put Sedley thoroughly in the realm of designer-adjacent niche, like modern Guerlain masculines and most of the Lalique line, but that isn't a bad thing. If you like citrus, smooth mint, and traditional barbershop elements over a modern oriental base, plus have the cash to blow, this could be a serious option. With that in mind, I give Parfums de Marly Sedley a thumbs up. ",

			"content": "A very fresh,  semi-spicy, significantly aromatic fragrance deriving  a good deal of its character from a bright rosemary note supported by geranium and mint. A touch of citruses up top lend it even more freshness while the base of ambrox gives it a sweet, modern-woody finish. This has the character of fragrances such as Viking and Sauvage--exceptionally modern scents that leave the impression of a classic spicy aftershave composed of mediterranean spices with a clean, masculine appeal. While it doesn't smell like the aforementioned scents it has similar qualities in terms of its structure, density, development, and general character. Sedley is a pleasant, enjoyable fragrance that may suffer from a lack of performance depending on one's standards and expectations. It's certainly one of Parfums de Marly's lighter fragrances. I get about 6 hours of longevity with good projection for the first hour followed by several more hours where it sits closer to the skin. While wafts of it will continue to catch the air throughout its duration, it settles in considerably after the initial hour of application. These qualities make Sedley a nice choice as a daytime fragrance during the warmer months, or an indoor, office type of scent all year around. However, those who demand top-notch performance may be disappointed by Sedley and it's easy-going, soft projection. As of today, Sedley has been released exclusively through Nordstrom, in conjunction with Parfums de Marly. Whether or not it becomes a more widespread, available release and part of PdM's core lineup is yet to be seen. It's very possible however, as scents like Carlisle and Akaster began as Harrods exclusives themselves, and are now available in a variety of locations. While PdM isn't breaking any new ground here, and some may complain about its performance, overall Sedley is an enjoyable, likable fresh aromatic with enough unique character to stand out and feel like its own fragrance. It's definitely the freshest among all Marly releases, feeling a bit more uplifting, crisp and  current than Galloway--worth sampling , and for right person, even worthy of a blind buy.

			"content": "Spice Blend is among the latest releases from the Maison Christian Dior line, the higher-end wing of Dior fragrances that replaced the Privee-named line.  The rum and the spicy notes (cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper) factor in most strongly to my notes, but it doesn\u2019t come off overly pungently spicy.  It\u2019s not sneeze-inducing spicy, but rather, tastefully spicy, with the rum remaining fairly prominent throughout.  Initially, it smells like Mugler Pure Malt without the A*Men tar/patchouli vibe, kind of the smoother booziness on top, but it becomes spicier with time and this notion fades but is still present even after a number of hours on skin.\n\r\nIt\u2019s very much in the spirit of the MCD line\u2014light and agreeable, very much in contrast to the more daring releases from the previous Privee line along the lines of Cuir Cannage, Leather Oud, and eventually, Feve Delicieuse.  Spice Blend has the benefit of being more signature-scent-worthy, though, like Purple Oud, though I expect that makes it more appealing for passersby and fans of mainly designer releases than niche fragheads.\n\r\nAvailable at the same pricing as the rest of the line at $220 for 125ml, I still regard the Dior Privee / MCD lines as unusually well-priced in the market as far as the high-end designer lines.  That said, certainly the more recent MCD releases have been generally lighter and less daring and perhaps less worthy of higher-end pricing than the previous Privee releases.  Nevertheless, I\u2019ve found several that I really think are quite great in the new line\u2014namely, Balade Sauvage, Purple Oud, and Diorissima.  Santal Noir is another one worth checking out, and I have high hopes for Jasmin Des Anges and Happy Hour, though I need to try both still.\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a very nice offering but a \u201clike\u201d not a \u201clove\u201d for me.  It\u2019s pleasant, a sold masculine, signature-scent-worthy offering, but not quite bold enough to be full bottle-worthy, at least not for me.   Still, it performs quite well and should be a nice option for lots of people out there, especially men looking for a cold-weather-friendly signature-type of scent that transitions well into evening wearing while still being office-friendly enough.

For a crowd pleasing line like Le Male, this is a vast improvement. But, it also doesn't land among my favorite tropical fragrances. The coconut feels a little too light and synthetic, especially to be the star of the show. I mostly get that and tonka, with very little citrus.

			"content": "Mancera Precious Oud is yet another 2019 release the Montale/Mancera empire that keeps churning out new fragrances like a factory.  I really enjoyed sampling Montale Oud Dream the other day and Mancera Precious Oud does not disappoint, either.  The note list is complex, not Roja-esque, but a lot more than the rose/patchouli/oud breakdown of Oud Dream.\n\r\nPrecoius Oud has the rose and oud, unsurprisingly, but it has sweet and boozy hints as well: tiramisu, whiskey, and leather are listed verbatim, along with a handful of florals and a familiar dry down of patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, and oakmoss.  So the note list is a lot to digest, no food pun intended, but the upshot for me as a balance between a rose/oud fragrance and a gourmand sweet/boozy fragrance, and a pretty even balance, at that.  It\u2019s a nod to both the rose/oud lovers and gourmand lovers.\n\r\nAs usual, the performance is very strong, certainly more than satisfactory for the type of scent it is, something I\u2019d be more inclined to wear in cooler weather, when the juice needs to be a bit stronger to stand out.  \n\r\nI might not quite love it as much as Oud Dream but it\u2019s surely a winner, for me, one I need to try some more but a release that I\u2019m impressed with upon trying it even just once.\n\r\nThe only retail option in the US that I see for now is Osswald NYC, a great shop, but they\u2019re currently sold out of it, and it\u2019s almost certainly at the standard Mancera pricing of $180 for 120m\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m very pleased with this one, another banger from this company.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n\n",

			"content": "One of Mancera\u2019s more recent releases, Instant Crush, is a sugary vanilla citrus floral that\u2019s an easy winner for those that like vanilla but want to keep it fresh and light, as well.  This is not a weighted-down, cake-like vanilla, or even a boozy vanilla, but rather, a medium-bodied vanilla that has the tip-of-the-tongue sugary sweetness initially but that does not remain candied throughout its life.  The opening is citrus-laden and zesty, with mixed citruses, saffron, and ginger, but quickly gives way to a more floral heart of rose and jasmine, with a dry down of vanilla, sandalwood, and musk.   It\u2019s a solid formula for a versatile player.  The vanilla isn\u2019t overwhelming to start despite the mix having a sharp sweetness from the onset, but it becomes a little creamier and more of an overall woody vanilla musk blend in the dry down.\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen comparisons to MFK Baccarat Rouge 540, and I don\u2019t feel that the analogy holds up for more than a moment.  Out of the atomizer or when briefly in air, there\u2019s some sort of sweet commonality.\n\r\nInstant Crush has the standard Mancera pricing of $180 for 120ml, which isn\u2019t bad at all if you want it now, as great retailers like Alan Berdjis at Beverly Hills Perfumery will probably have it available at some point, or you can wait to raid the grey market.\n\r\nI don\u2019t find its performance to be all that special; it\u2019s boastful to start but because fairly mellow after a few hours of wearing, so it\u2019s nice as a casual option but not at all up to par with many of the other offerings in the gargantuan Mancera/Montale catalogue.\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a nice agreeable vanilla that\u2019s fresh with citrus and florals but not overly feminine on the floral side.  Certainly for those that find it similar to MFK BR540, it\u2019s a lot cheaper, but I really don\u2019t think that they\u2019re all that alike.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "This perfume is a love song to the helonial aldehyde, sharp, metallic, and unforgivingly bright. Tom Ford perfumes seldom have trouble being unconventional, even if their single accord focus makes them somewhat linear, but they tend to stand up as wearable art for fans of the house. M\u00e9tallique (2019) is really no different in execution when you think about it, but it also brings together a certain old-school complexity thanks to the chypre genre it revisits, but is still properly synthetic like a modern designer. In case the name didn't give it away, this stuff smells like metal, just like someone took the smell of a chrome bumper and wrapped a feminine-market fragrance around it. I like this, but not sure if I could pull it off, due to just how prominent that metallic aldehyde is in the mix. \n\r\nM\u00e9tallique opens with that aforementioned sharpness, carried by bergamot, helonial, and pink pepper. The rakishness does tone down in time, allowing a softer heliotrope note to move in, bolstered by muguet and hawthorn (the death flower). This stripped white floral core becomes the pulse of the chromium beast that is M\u00e9tallique for the next few hours until ambrette and vanilla slowly sneak up to form a base. There's some sort of \"sandalwood\" woody base here (that isn't sandalwood) but helps establish the dry chypre accord that this finished in after about the 6 hour mark. M\u00e9tallique is pretty daring and austere in the way icy sharp chypres like Chanel Cristalle (1974) and Jacomo Silences (1978) are, but bright enough to be \"modern\" to most mainstream noses. Wear time is about 10 hours with moderate sillage, and this feels best for office use due to its emotionless delivery.\n\r\nIf Tom Ford is trying to bring back the old Cruella DeVille chypres of the late 70's, he may just succeed with M\u00e9tallique, but only within the context of his fanbase. I don't see this catching fire the way Black Orchid (2006) has, and likely will end up going the way of Sahara Noir (2013) after a few years, meaning M\u00e9tallique may be another Tom Ford unicorn in the making, much like his axed Private Blend lines and former LVMH scents like Yves Saint Laurent Nu (1999), M7 (2002), Gucci Pour Homme (2002), and Rive Gauche Pour Homme (2003). Again, not sure this fits my personality but I can appreciate the concept, and see this as easily being unisex. Despite over-inflated prices and often painfully linear executions within the Private Blends line, sometimes the single-minded house style of Tom Ford hits creative pay dirt, and that is definitely the case here with M\u00e9tallique.

The sheer amount of conceptualization and marketing fluff surrounding M\u00e9moire d'une Odeur (2019) is a bit off-putting, and the vintage-looking bottle a bit misleading, but overall this is an admirable effort. In a manner similar to Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiore (2018), this tries to bring green verdant accords back into the mainstream, but unlike Acqua di Fiore, doesn't gobsmack with grassy notes (something I like but not a popular vibe in the 21st century for sure). Instead, M\u00e9moire d'une Odeur leans on soft musks, a mineralic edge similar to Terre d'Herm\u00e8s (2008) or Bottega Veneta Pour Homme (2013), and jasmine hedione to boldly \"establish a new olfactive family\" of the \"aromatic mineralic\", but I don't think we're getting an era-defining genre like the chypre out of this. Also, the bottle that inspired the packaging of M\u00e9moire d'une Odeur is an early 90's repackage of Eau de Gucci (1982), their first scent. Quite a nice little trick, but I think it will backfire because retro style is a hard sell to Gucci's current market and vintage purists will call this out as smoke and mirrors. Casual fans may dig the kitsch appeal of the bottle, and the rather quiet scent will offend no one.\n\r\nM\u00e9moire d'une Odeur opens with that signature chamomile, which is probably the most unique and innovative thing about the scent. Alberto Morillas penned this, so don't expect anything too daring because he is inexorably and almost self-defeatingly bent on mass-appeal this late into his perfume career, particularly leaning on AI technology he helped develop as master perfumer at Firmenich. Past this opening, M\u00e9moire d'une Odeur transforms into a greener muskier Mugler Cologne (2001), another scent Morillas worked on, and becomes quite soapy. The jasmine comes out to play, followed by a play-doh smell that I can only imagine is the mineral accord, after which some woody aromachemical impressions emerge (sandalwood and cedar says Gucci), ending in green-tinted white musk. Maybe there's a bit of Haitian vetiver in the mix, but all told, this comes across as a hybrid of the musk from Calvin Klein cK One (1994), which is yet another project Morillas was on, the aforementioned Mugler Cologne, and the novelty accords of chamomile and minerals. It's not bad and totally unisex, but also sort of listless, boring and too self-referential of a Morillas scent for enthusiasts to care. Wear time is brief like a cologne, with mild sillage to boot, so performance is questionable for the price. I'd also use this in spring/summer and only in the most casual of settings, or at night because chamomile is rather relaxing. I'd say this is a good before-bed scent in a similar vein to a lavender splash, but that's it.\n\r\nM\u00e9moire d'une Odeur is another mildly adventurous scent from the \"new\" Gucci under Alessandro Michele, but it seems there is diminishing returns on this adventurous spirit as the scents slowly become more staid and conventional down the line, while the stories behind each new release become taller and taller, showing evidence that accountants and shareholders are flexing their late-stage Capitalism muscle on the house and once again slowly steering them back to mass-appeal waters. It's a shame really, because Gucci Bloom (2016) and Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme (2017) were so darned interesting and promosing, but I guess \"interesting\" is mostly the provenance of higher-margin niche perfumes where taking risks is easier to justify, and \"promising\" now belonging to the realm of self-taught artisanal perfumers. Overall, fans of soapy, lightly-musky, and easy-going fragrances will enjoy this, but only as a tonic of sorts. M\u00e9moire d'une Odeur is marketed unisex but I have a feeling this will appeal more to feminine tastes due to how low-key the scent profile is, since the 2010's is the second age of the powerhouse for most men. For the price, there are better eau de colognes or soapy spa-like scents out there, and I'm not terribly enamored with chamomile as a fragrance statement myself, but I'll give a nod to Gucci for doing something different, even if it's not for me. Test and see for yourself. Neutral.",

It took ten minutes for the fragrance to warm up and meld with my skin; but when it did, a soapy musk with a touch of white floral and a slightly sweet herbal note unfolded. Over time, the musk became slightly snuggly--my skin but better. It took me a few wears before I became comfortable identifying the chamomile note.

			"content": "I think this may be my new winner for best grapefruit perfume.\n\r\nGrapefruit is a notoriously difficult note because it usually has a bile/vomit undertone.  Some grapefruit perfumes just pretend that the vomit is \"musk\" and leave it (Guerlain and Czech & Speak, I'm looking at you...).  Jo Malone, my previous favorite grapefruit, eliminated the vomit and sweetened everything into grapefruit candy.  M\u00e9die wins by leaving the grapefruit sour and juicy, while lifting it with black pepper.\n\r\nM\u00e9die doesn't actually do much - the grapefruit sticks around after the pepper drifts away, eventually fading into pineapple.  If there's a proper base, it's so weak that I don't smell anything of note, but M\u00e9die lasts quite a few hours as is, so this is ok.\n\r\nThe combination of grapefruit and pepper smells retro to me.  The pepper-topped minimalism calls to mind Bulgari's tea collection and some of Jean Claude Elena's work, and it occurs to me that M\u00e9die is basically the topnotes of Terre d'Hermes with all of the artful weirdness removed.  That being said, it works and would likely make a nice office/airplane scent for when you'd like something crowd-pleasing but still different.  Nice!",

			"content": "Armani Orangerie Venise is one of the most recent releases from the Prive collection, composed by Dominique Ropion.  I smelled it in passing in Neiman Marcus some weeks ago and was rather instantly taken by it, as it\u2019s fairly rare nowadays that a citrus/neroli-intensive type of fragrance stands out, but this was clearly did it, and so I was generously gifted a couple of samples by the nice store associate.\n\r\nOrangerie Venise smells of a mix of neroli, petitgrain, orange, and florals, in that order, with some interesting complexity that renders it neither particularly bright nor especially woodsy, so it doesn\u2019t veer into the territory of, say, Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Forte.  It\u2019s overall fairly smooth, but with just enough citrus bite, via the orange bigarade I gather, to remind that it\u2019s a citrus fragrance.   The base notes are cedar, moss, and ambroxan, and create an easy, woody, albeit forgettable bed for the rest to land on.\n\r\nIt\u2019s sophisticated, inventive, fresh, and interesting, and frankly a bit difficult to explain, given the abundance of neroli fragrances in the market, but the key takeaway for me is that it\u2019s nuanced and performs reasonably well, all things considered.\n\r\nPriced at $175 for 100ml retail, it\u2019s at the more modest end of Armani Prive, contra the dark-bottle fragrances in the $300 range, but it\u2019s probably available even cheaper with discounts or (eventually) on the secondary market, so it\u2019s not a bad deal and likely to get better.  This is surely on my radar to retry and perhaps grab a bottle of.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

The original is still probably more unique with its sour ginger, as pink pepper is really prevalent everywhere nowadays \u2013 as is rose. But I thoroughly enjoyed the really punchy pepper (it starts off stronger than it's usual for pink pepper, it's similar to black pepper to me at the start, though it mellows down and softens later, unfortunately) and I liked the slightly sour combo of rose and patchouli probably a bit more than slightly sweet and creamy combo of tuberose and sandalwood of original.\n\r\nFor now, I'm not planning to get myself neither one of the sisters, but I'd be really glad to get any of them as a gift. They both are pretty cheerful and energetic, and optimistic, and young, and carefree, and stylish, and pretty. Just like the ad says. ",

			"content": "Overture is easily one of Amouage\u2019s best releases in recent years. To put it simply: It\u2019s excellent. Its excellence begins with the rich, aromatic, elegant woody structure around which it\u2019s built. The wood is reminiscent of high quality antique furniture, passed down from generations, or the inside of a wooden cognac distillery cask once emptied of its contents and left to dry. It\u2019s aromatic and vibrant\u2014far from the dull, vague concoctions that often pass for woods\u2014and with a full-bodied, substantial presence. It\u2019s also natural and easy on the senses\u2014a stark contrast to how synthetic woods are typically constructed today, laden with abrasive, aggressive aromachemicals. Along with the sandalwood, cognac also plays an important role in Overture, and here it\u2019s added in just the right proportion and strength. It accents the wood, providing it with character and dimension, but never overpowering it. It\u2019s tastefully refined and restrained, and you don\u2019t have to worry about smelling like you spilled a drink on yourself while wearing it. The cognac is strongest upon Overture\u2019s opening and it gradually settles in as it reaches the base, never fully disappearing, and leaving pleasant boozy traces well into the final hour. Myrrh is the third significant component to Overture and I\u2019ve found it does two things very well. First, its aromatic incense adds to the warm, smoky-dusty profile of the sandalwood, bolstering it, and making it stronger and more intense. But secondly, it also brings a soft vanilla-benzoin-like resinous cushion to the base, rounding the edges of the woods just a bit and really adding to the overall relaxed, comfortable feeling of Overture. \n\r\nThis is an elegant, mature fragrance, and as a result it is not exceptionally strong or \u201cbeast mode,\u201d despite being completely solid and fully present. Its projection and intensity has been calibrated to just the right level. Other people will certainly smell this on you, but it is not of the loud, attention-seeking variety. Having said that, I\u2019ve never worn this and thought to myself, \u201cI wish they just increased the ________.\u201d Overture\u2019s been carefully created with balance and proportion in mind and it absolutely shows. Similarly, while Overture is something of a serious scent, it has plenty of character and a relaxed, comforting naturalness that keep it from ever feeling stern or stuffy. Performance is good, with well-calibrated projection (two feet at most, about a foot for the majority of its time) and 8 hour longevity. Most importantly, those 8 hours are enjoyable. It never for a moment outwears its welcome, and just the opposite, becomes more endearing over the course of a wearing. Final rating: 9/10\n\r\nSide note: This is what I had hoped Lalique\u2019s Ombr\u00e9 Noire was going to be. I bought ON first, before Overture, loving its note pyramid and description. But it was a disappointment. It was out of balance, and the boozy note was way too strong. While it looked like a charming scent on paper, in reality it felt too austere and without a personality. It was void of that \u201cX Factor\u201d which serves as the bridge between a good smell and one\u2019s heart. I guess you could say that it lacked character. I didn\u2019t like ON at all and it made me hesitant to purchase Overrture. Here I had just utterly failed at blind buying a boozy woody fragrance with a very interesting, lengthy pyramid of notes. How would I fare with another boozy woods that only listed 3 main notes? Fortunately, I took the plunge and Overture turned out to be exactly what I was looking for all along. Despite its short list of notes it has plenty of character and dimension, and enough nuance to keep it interesting and fun to wear.",

			"content": "The latest men\u2019s fragrance from Amouage is Overture Man, a rather straightforward blend of cognac at the top, myrrh in the heart, and sandalwood in the base.  It opens with a sharp boozy whiff, less indulgent in a sweet way and more realistic with the bite.  I enjoy more fantastic interpretations of cognac than the real thing, which is quite acerbic, but I frankly give credit to Amouage Overture Man incorporating a less sweet boozy note of cognac in this, at least initially.  Myrrh feels like a natural-enough partner for the cognac, providing almost a creamy contrast in this context to the sharper cognac, with the woody base of sandalwood rounding things out. \n\r\nThe fragrance actually evolves substantially somewhat after several hours into a sweeter blend, the bitingness of the cognac being supplanted by a sweet, creamy booziness of the cognac in concert with the myrrh.  This a twist that I didn\u2019t see coming and quite enjoy. \n\r\nOverture Man smells ever so slightly more complex than its note breakdown, which is straightforward enough, and with that makes for a fairly blunt cold-weather-leaning, mostly-masculine scent.  As usual, I can\u2019t make much sense of the fragrance\u2019s name, but it\u2019s masculine, at least.  It feels like a reliable blend, something I could wear comfortable enough in cooler weather.\n\r\nPerformance-wise, it\u2019s quite strong, perhaps not to the level of Interlude/Memoir/Epic but just a notch down, a lot of kick to open, with a big scent cloud and fading to still-dense concoction after hours of wearing.    As far as I can tell, it\u2019s only available today on Harrods\u2019 website at $270 for 100ml, not yet having reach the US markets, but this pricing is consistent with Amouage nowadays, some fragrances being more in the $300 range, even.\n\r\nI\u2019m pleased with it, even though its opening is a bit harsher than what I\u2019d typically like to wear as far as perfume inspired by liquor or fortified wine. Still, a \u201clike\u201d not a \u201clove\u201d overall, and that\u2019s okay, though I can see this working well for lots of men, especially.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

I know there's Myrrh is Atlantic Ambergris too, but it got me wondering if there is perhaps a bit of Ambergris in Overture too. Hmm...would be interesting to find out if there was. Anyway, I do enjoy this and think it will wear very nicely this fall and winter especially. Two thumbs up!",

			"content": "I once visited a festival of desserts. It was hosted, appropriately, in a recently built faux castle (such events demand \u2018romantic\u2019 trappings) and within, among the masses of tall-candles and liveried waiting staff, were long tables laid out with serried rows of mega-froufroued individual desserts \u2013 garnished, glazed, food coloured to perfection, and oozing all the dairy fats (whisked, whipped, reduced) that any self-respecting glutton could desire. It seemed like a good idea at the time to spend an evening gorging on bavaroix and gateaux \u00e0 volont\u00e9, but the aftermath was decidedly queasy.\r\nNo such queasiness about Sixteen92\u2019s delightful Such a Misfit which is a gourmand bomb with a difference. It goes light where others go heavy and its cascade of sweets has surprising depths, floury and malty tones to the fore rather than syrup. And it actually smells of real-life referents rather than just a heavy hand with the ole ethyl maltol. So from its wonderfully textured opening of just-baked coconut-topped biscuits and hot, buttered popcorn, with fruity candied accents darting about in between, to its dreamycreamy drydown which is a combination of the comforting smells of pan-roasted flour, butter extract and the finest drizzle of vanilla sugar, it doesn\u2019t put a step wrong.  Projection remains within your personal space rather than being broadcast wider. Just a shame it was a limited edition that came and went  \n\n",

			"content": "I'm a bit conflicted about Limone di Sicilia.  There's a lot here I've enjoyed, but despite that, somehow it keeps feeling a bit unremarkable.\n\r\nSo what does it smell like?  The topnotes remind me of a traditional lemon cologne, with lemon blossom or linden to give it floral depth, and a pinch of mint to give it an herbal green sharpness.\n\r\nIt fairly quickly fades to a floral smell that's a bit hard to describe.  Have you smelled a rose that doesn't officially have a scent - it smells kind of wet and green and floral, even a bit rosy, but more like part of a plant than specifically a flower.  Limone di Sicilia does a remarkable job recreating that \"unscented flower\" smell, with little vapors of fruity rose hovering in the sillage. \n\r\nIt dries back down to lemon again, this time paired with creamy musks.\n\r\nI've liked how this smells, but somehow feel underwhelmed, like there's a sheen of designer familiarity enveloping this perfume - it's quite artful when examined closely, but still exudes the feeling of a dumb fruity floral despite its intelligence.  That's why I'm voting neutral despite some really clever twists.",

But,  if you apply lightly it is sea worthy replica of ocean air when out on the high seas.  I have smelled this bright aquatic opening before from various blue scents from Nautica,  Montblanc, Bond No.9.com as well as Chez Bond, so I assume that this a common synthetic \"oceanic\" blend which can reliably produce sharp dry oceanic notes and it works for that. Huron has a light green turn which blends in from a bit of vetiver and then eases into a soft sandalwood white musk calmer seas ending. \n\r\n      I like how Huron when lightly applied gives the impression of cold ocean spray air and stays strong for 3 hours and is heat activation ready for the whole day.

			"content": "What you see is what you get. Goodfellow wants in on the fragrance pie too, just like every other company out there. I personally love their clothing line at Target. I remember some time ago when they were an actual upscale brand, and their clothing is still high quality. But their fragrances.. well.. \n\r\nThis one was the most hyped of the initial 4 released, so I did what any other curious BN'er would do, and I blind bought a bottle. Do I regret it? I think so, but not as much as other purchases I've made. No 6 smells good. In fact, it smells fantastic.. if you're lucky enough to smell it before it's gone. It's an EDC that performs worse than an EDC. With advances in perfumery, I have come to expect EDC's to even last longer. Old Spice manages to make their classic fragrance last for 4+ hours, with moderate projection, and it's basically an aftershave! Plus, there are plenty of other \"colognes\" that have fantastic performance. This is not one of them. This is thin, watered down to the fullest intent, and packaged nicely with an alluring style, that people who love Goodfellow clothing will gravitate towards. Good job Goodfellow, you suckered me in.\n\r\nBut, I knew a little more when coming to this dance. I read a little bit on Basenotes about it. The little I did read, might as well have not read it at all. except for that we can all agree that the price is bordering on absurd for what you're getting. $20 for 1.7 oz of a fragrance that lasts 30 mins. I figure, at that rate, using 10-20 sprays per wearing, reapplying throughout the day, this bottle should last me no more than a week, and that's being generous, and if you don't believe me, try it for yourself. $20 a week for a 2 note, 1 dimensional fragrance, that has very little going on, is crazy, when you look at the big picture. That's roughly $1000 a year to smell like cedarwood and geranium. No thanks!\n\r\nLet's talk about the fragrance, shall we. It opens up with a very good cedar note, I have to say, it's a really good one, but it's also really watered down. I wonder what oils they used, because the cedar is great, and although, I wouldn't say 100% natural, it's pretty good. It's not that fake Iso E inspired, peppery cedar that we get from a lot of fragrances now a days, this is more authentic. While the geranium is certainly a green variety of it, it's not very floral, rather more green and herbal. The geranium peaks through more in the try down.\n\r\nThe price to value ratio just isn't there. It's not worth it, but it smells good. Though i could see this being good for somebody wanting something light and minimalistic as far as notes go. If this were $10 for 1.7 oz it would be a good deal, but at twice that, it's a crime! People are probably saying \"well it's only $20\", it isn't about what it costs now. It's about the cost per ml, and it's about the idea of price gouging, and that's what this is - Goodfellow putting their name on a product, in a market that is booming at its highest rate ever - fragrances, and capitalizing on the success. \n",

			"content": "The Moon goes on skin with a clean blast of red raspberry before quickly moving to its early heart.  As the composition enters the early heart, the raspberry remains, now joined by fecal, animalic real oud oil coupled with a lush rose and smooth patchouli tandem.  This stage lasts about an hour, before the the barnyard oud oil gradually recedes, slowly being replaced by a hardcore smokey, leathery oud wood chips approximation (likely cypriol derived) that joins what now is more of a \"vague red berry\" accord.  During the late dry-down, the red berry and hardcore leathery oud wood approximation now completely take the fore, as none of the initial real oud oil remains, only adding a hint of dry sandalwood to the final mix to tone down the ruggedness of the leathery oud wood as the composition very slowly moves toward its finish. Projection is excellent, and longevity legendary at nearly 24 hours on skin.\n\r\nAfter just coming off a mild disappointment with another of the Middle East series offerings from Malle in the past week (see the review of \"The Promise\"), it was with some trepidation that I approached the more expensive \"The Moon.\"  When I sprayed the composition on skin, I can only say that very few opens I have encountered to date smelled this good.  The red raspberry meshes perfectly with the rose, patchouli and real oud oil.  When sniffed up close, the animalic fecal aspects of the oud are in full-force, but unlike Malle's The Night where the oud oil assaults your senses throughout, The Moon tones the assault down to allow the raspberry, rose and patchouli to shine right along with it.  The sillage is actually where the composition impresses the most, as perfumer Rasquinet skillfully has the fecal aspects fade to the background, just leaving enough to add depth to the rest of the ingredients.  The end result is absolutely superb smelling and worth the lofty price of admission alone.  Alas, things are not all perfect with The Moon, as about two hours into the progression when the remnants of the oud oil vacate and the hardcore leathery oud chips approximation takes the fore, the composition becomes more like others in the genre, with the red berry accord and dry sandalwood keeping things different enough to still standout from the mob.  In this case, while the whole development smells great, I dare say the first couple hours are what this writer would love to bottle and cherish.  The bottom line in the case of the $750 per 100ml bottle of The Moon, is it really *is* all about the journey (and what a terrific one it is), earning an \"outstanding\" 4.5 stars out of 5 rating and an extremely strong recommendation to all who can afford it.

			"content": "I am a huge fan of the Aramis line of fragrances. They are almost always very high quality scents with good performance and reasonably priced. So when I spotted Aramis 'Special Blend' I was very excited and blind bought the fragrance right away. \n\r\nThis is a modern take on the classic 'Aramis' by Aramis original scent, with slightly floral and fruity notes at the top, and a sweet whiskey and amber base. The opening smells very similar to Costume National Homme, so if you are a fan of that scent, you will absolutely love this. \n\r\nThe middle of the scent settles into a warm, boozy masculine masterpiece, with solid projection that is present without being cloying or too loud. It performs well, and being an Eau de Parfum concentration, it is thick and digs into your skin and becomes your scent. It leaves a wonderful trail but is never offensive or irritating. The notes are very well blended and lay together is nearly perfect harmony. \n\r\nA base of woods, amber, and a bit of sweet tonka and what smells like the classic Aramis leather note is there and lasts for quite a while. This is the ideal fragrance for cold, winter days. You put this on with your scarf, leather jacket or winter coat and boots, and sip coffee by the fire with friends in a cafe full of stylish and attractive people. \n\r\nPerformance is good as it usually is with Aramis fragrances. Longevity with ten sprays (neck, chest, wrists, shoulders) is about 7-10+ hours, with several days on clothes and fabrics. Projection and sillage is heavy within the first hour, then moderate for about four hours. It lingers as a soft trail at the six hour mark until it becomes a skin scent. It is not quite as strong as the original 'Aramis' by Aramis, more of a slightly subdued version. But by no means is this a weak scent. It just has softer projection from the original version. \n\r\nIf you are a fan of the original 'Aramis' by Aramis or love Costume National Homme, this is a definitely must have. Powerhouse cologne lovers will also really enjoy this. This is for the mature, stylish and masculine gentleman who is 35+ years of age with confidence. Highly recommended.",

You would be wrong.\n\r\nAramis Special Reserve is a true oddity in today's market, even more than the underappreciated Tobacco Reserve was. If you had me try this blind and told me this was a fragrance from the early 90s, I'd probably have believed you, especially on the initial sniff.\n\r\nWhiskey is the backbone of Special Blend, but this sits very far from the sweet, gourmand-y territory occupied by a lot of contemporary \"boozy\" fragrances. What sweetness is here does not emerge until the pleasurable drydown, a kind of distant, mellow sweetness accented with cinnamon. The aldehydic opening gives Special Reserve a fizzy-fresh zing, shifting over to an aniseed blast that fades into an intensely woody heart with spicy-herbal accents. The impression I get is of bourbon whiskey spilled on tree bark that has been left to dry in the sun.\n\r\nThere's nothing cheap about this composition, with an overall aromatic aesthetic that leans slightly more artisanal than designer-y. \n\r\nI honestly can't think of any other scent quite like this, and, like all unusual scents, it's bound to be polarizing, but those with a taste for classic masculines should find a lot to admire.\n\r\nBravo, Aramis.",

			"content": "I think the most noticeable and significant smell that appears in Kalan shows up in the initial seconds that you apply it and then holds on for much of the fragrance's life. It's a very bitter, acerbic note approximating mastic oil, and whether's it's the blood orange absolute or orange blossom absolute, or perhaps the resulting combination of both, it colors the entire scent, giving it a fresh, bitterly aromatic slant, and not something that is necessarily immediately likable or mass-appealing. At the same time, this very smell is the charm of Kalan, and what makes it potentially a very addictive and peculiar scent. Behind this bitter smell (whatever it is exactly) is the resinous roasted sugar that's so often been compared to Baccarat Rouge 540. In my opinion, the comparison is warranted in regard to this particular accord, though overall when the other notes and smells are taken into account the two are very different fragrances. This sweet, roasted quality gradually amplifies, gaining in size and sweetness, as the bitter counterpart slowly begins to settle in and loses a good deal of its edgy, acerbic aroma. Still, a small amount remains and provides a fresh balance to the overall composition, keeping it from becoming completely dominated by the dark, roasted sugar below. The truth about this fresh aspect of Kalan, is that I don't really know what it is. It shows qualities of what could be interpreted as blood orange, but also is in line with aspects of orange blossom and to some extent oakmoss. But really it doesn't smell exactly like any of them. It's almost as if all of those notes are working together to create this larger accord that balances Kalan's sweet side, and it needs to be smelled to be fully understood. It's also what will probably make it or break it for you. And while you might recoil at first, don't be surprised if you find yourself coming back to experience it again, and eventually really enjoying this strange note. \n\r\nKalan is strong, and it holds on for a good while, projecting intensely for at least 3 or 4 hours before reeling itself in, but still remaining somewhat substantial and present for another 4. . It is not a weak scent at all, and 2 or 3 sprays should do you perfectly well for most situations. In relation to their other releases, I'd place Kalan in the top 25 percent--not my favorite, but among my top 5 for sure. I find it a pretty daring release too. The opening accord is so bizarre it's sure to scare away the faint of heart, but it's also where the payoff is, and those who like their fragrances unique and different may really enjoy it. In conclusion, I'd give Kalan a solid 8/10. It's a distinct fragrance that performs well, and despite sharing some similarity with BR540, it's really its own scent in the end. Recommended for sampling. Due to the very distinct bitter notes which drive it, I do not recommend this as a blind buy. \n\r\nFinal Note: Yeah I know some of you get really annoyed by the fact that people are always comparing your beloved PdM's to other fragrances, but the fact that this happens all the time should tell you something--Marly often takes popular accords or concepts and finds their own ways to freak them, often churning out something better and different enough in the process, but still reminiscent of some earlier releases from different houses. Just accept the fact that uniqueness doesn't account for everything, and that it's still okay to like PdM and tout the greatness of what they put out. With that in mind, I do think that Kalan is its own fragrance, but understand why 540 is frequently mentioned when describing it. It's a good reference point, and I think arguing that point is simply reactionary and obtuse, as there is indeed a clear connection between them. Having said that, here's my comparison of the two and where I think they're similar and different: Baccarat Rouge begins and stays much sweeter, woodier, and has those sweet, crystalline red notes which are altogether absent in Kalan. Baccarat Rouge seems to employ more ambroxan, which I find present in Kalan but not nearly to the same degree. Kalan has much more of a bitter, biting edge, and a freshness which 540 lacks. This is a huge difference between the two and really what makes them completely different fragrance. Kalan is also spicier, and more aromatic than 540, and it reaches into a higher register, but also into a lower register. I suppose it's more dynamic in that sense, reaching higher up in its freshness, but even lower in the roasted quality of the heart. In the end, they're only about 40% the same, and I own both and don't find them to be redundant. Personally, I prefer 540 as I find it more pleasant and a bit more interesting at its core. \n\r\nEDIT: I have to update this review because otherwise I feel that what I'm leaving up here would be dishonest. I got really sick of Kalan very quickly. After a while I just found the opening so harsh and unpleasant, and it started to really hurt my nose every time I used it.  Rather than this aspect becoming the addictive allure I thought it might be, instead it became very annoying. The opening is just too bitter and harsh and chemically aggressive. While I found that aspect interesting and addictive at first, it became very grating after a while. I ended up selling this. I would reduce my final rating to a 7/10 and say that I greatly prefer Baccarat Rouge.",

			"content": "This fragrance is FIRE.\n\r\nSo, I am not very familiar with the notes of Blood orange or Orange blossom, however the others yes.\r\nKalan is loud and boisterous and if you spray more than 2-3 sprays you will choke, I REPEAT you will suffocate. A little goes a longggggg way - I have a 2.5oz bottle and realize that this will last for a lifetime!\n\r\nAs many have noted, there is a sweet yet very woodsy greenish element that comes through right away. This fragrance is very stringent. Potent! Good! I get the dichotomy of woods versus sweets, as if they are playing a game of tug-of-war. Neither win but remain constant, firm, and grounded. I think Kalan is a nice fragrance, and yet a rather atypical offering from the PdM line (psss...If you try real hard, you will get some of the apple pie spice goodness as nuanced in other PdM fragrances).\n\r\nInitially, Kalan can be a turn off because of its grand appearance. I must say, give it a moment to settle and you will not be disappointed. A fragrance that almost wants to go in the candied direction completely because of the combination of Blood Orange, Orange Blossom, Amber and Spices but stops and decides to turn around and go in the green direction. Perhaps, due to the mixture of Lavendar, White Sandalwood, Moss, and Woods\u2026it's weird, but in a good way. Many compare this to MFKBR 540, however, I cannot add anything to that comparison as I have not tried that fragrance.\n\r\nI can see how this could be unisex, however, in my opinion this is more for the masculine crowd. I really like it and more than likely it will be in the regular rotation. :o)\n\r\nProjection: 9/10...others WILL notice;\r\nLongevity: 9/10....remains on deck ALL day;\r\nSilage: 8.5/10\u2026..the degree to which others around you would notice is VERY high;\r\nPerformance: 9/10\u2026PERFORMS extremely well on the skin;\r\nOverall: 9/10",

			"content": "Upon initial smell, Kalan was intriguing to me, but I wasn't wowed by it. After another sampling on paper, I was more intrigued and not 100% sure how I felt about it. 3rd time was the charm, because I couldn't stop smelling the test strip and ended up buying a 75ml bottle. After a couple of wearings, I think this is an excellent fragrance. A true \"niche\" offering from Parfums de Marly, a house that sometimes toes the line between high high end designer and niche light, this is a well constructed, interesting and unique fragrance that also happens to smell great.\n\r\nBlood Orange and spicy Pepper dominate the top for me, and for me personally, the spicy notes in Kalan play a role throughout the entire lifecycle of the fragrance. There's body here from the Oakmoss, Amber, and Tonka in the base, but those top notes make it a really interesting composition, and unlike anything else in my wardrobe.\n\r\nLongevity is excellent, sillage trail seems good too. This one hangs in the air (in a good way) especially the first few hours after application, but I find myself getting projection/wafts 8+ hours into wearing it. If presentation is something you're into, the bottle is stunning. The matte red finish is boss and for once, what's inside a flashy (but tasteful) bottle actually lives up to how it looks (looking @ you, Lavender Extreme).\n\r\nKalan isn't a dumb reach or the easiest wear in your wardrobe by any stretch, but it's a fantastic fragrance, and you'll stand out in a crowd of generic freshies. An instant favorite of mine from PdM (Carlisle, Layton and Herod also up there), and IMO a standout release from 2019. ",

			"content": "It's no secret that I am less than enthused about the house of Parfums de Marly, as I find their  marketing based on Louis XV of France to be a reach and almost trite in delivery, while the majority of their compositions derivative of modern designers despite supposedly being inspired by antiquity. However, I do give the luxury market upstarts credit where credit is due when a bit of ingenuity and uniqueness peeks out of their otherwise banal aromachemical landscape of nuclear-powered designer clones sold at prestige prices. Kalan (2019) is one such stroke of ingenuity, deviating from the usual US market-friendly form of sweet club-oriented upscale tonka and ambrox bombs in the same way their mid 2010's oud series did, but is actually sold in the US market unlike the erstwhile ouds. Kalan is a challenging fragrance that flies in the face of what the house usually stands for, and will likely not elicit compliments to the wearer, but will absolutely make a statement. I have a feeling this love or hate addition to the line will flunk out of high end department stores, but will be the darling of niche boutiques and online discounters, like many of the older Parfum de Marly scents nobody really talks about anymore.\n\r\nThe opening of Kalan is dry blood orange, black pepper, and dusty nutmeg. This is the kind of opening that almost merges the late 2010's blood orange trope from scents like Eros Flame (2019) and Dolce & Gabbana K (2019) with the pepper of something like Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb (2012) and a wall of dry aromatics seen in powerhouses from nearly 40 years ago. In particular, scents like Bijan for Men (1981) and Cacharel pour L'Homme (1981) ae brought to mind in the opening, but the modern sensibility of lavandin mixed with a soft neroli emerges in the heart, to reel in the abrasive opening from locking in the mood. The base of Kalan is very similar to the \"sweet near nothingness\" of Maison Francis Kurkdijan Baccarat Rouge 540 (2015), and claims to contain oakmoss, sandalwood, \"roasted tonka bean\", and some other silliness, but is really just the usual aromachemical wizardy found in any other Parfums de Marly scent. As expected with this house, the budget is blown on the top and heart, with a standard-issue chem firm assembly line  base, but unlike most PdM creations, this base doesn't suffocate the rest thanks to that Baccarat Rouge 540 mimicry, letting the rather fun composition on top do most of the talking. Longevity is undying and sillage immense like most PdM, while usage for me feels formal.\n\r\nKalan feels like the more mature alternative to many of the peppery scents that have graced the niche world as of late, being a strong contender against Creed Royal Oud (2011), and a step up from the aforementioned Spicebomb. Kalan is a great winter option too, although I can't say for sure in what company something like this will work best. Guys that love the old bergamot nutmeg bombs from the 80's but want to move into the future, and have the budget to afford a Parfums de Marly scent might find a home for Kalan in their collection, but you have to really like black pepper to make this leap. Baccarat Rouge 540 always bothered me as a scent that isn't really a scent, and is neither present nor absent, the real Schr\u00f6dinger's cat of the niche world, but Kalan effectively builds a complete new scent ontop of it the way Jacques Guerlain used to use completed past scents as the base for new ones, which delights me in ways hard to articulate. Whether you want to view this as a \"more complete BR 540\" or its own animal is up to you, but Parfums de Marly Kalan is one of the few of the recent entries worth checking out if the price is within your realm of possibility, because there's obviously little way of getting around that.

It\u2019s not really animalic so much as it as a semi-leathery but wholly spicy barrage.  However, it reasonably quickly fades into a more agreeable blend.\n\r\nFor a spicy scent, it\u2019s not as sophisticated or well-blended as Nisean, another PDM offering, in my opinion, but that it dries down from a spicy opening to a more subtle dry down makes Kalan a good but not great release from the house, though I\u2019m glad its pricing is significantly lower than other recent releases from the house.\n\r\nI started out being blas\u00e9 toward it but ended up liking it a bit, overall.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

It is very low-key, but has the consistent performance of a pilot light. It goes on in an understated way and continues in the same vein for many hours. It starts with strong petitgrain, pink pepper and perhaps a hint of ginger. It goes from aromatics to woods, and final act is one of a very familiar orange-amber-cedar affair. I caught wafts of my own scent throughout the day and was never less than impressed. The quality, after two testings and some unsought feedback from Mrs FWF, shines through in the seamless transitions and the excellent performance, as well as its blue-chip, zero-risk masculine design. \n\r\nThe lesson?

			"content": "4160 Tuesdays Clouds Illusion EDP is one of several products of a campaign in 2019 in the Eau My Soul group on Facebook inspired by the Joni Mitchell song \u201cBoth Sides Now,\u201d resulting in Clouds (with more natural ingredients) in both EDP and Parfum form, as well as Clouds Illusion (with fewer natural ingredients) in both EDP and Parfum form.  \n\r\nI chose the Clouds Illusion EDP in a 50ml size, and I\u2019ve really been delighted by the fragrance since first smelling it.  The principal notes are orris, narcissus, vanilla, hay, and sandalwood\u2014recreations, as opposed to Clouds, which is composed of more natural (and therefore more expensive) ingredients.  \n\r\nClouds Illusion is bright, sweet, powdery, and fresh, a mix of sweetness of the vanilla, powdery and creamy qualities of the orris, the lovely narcissus, and some of the pep of the hay, over what I perceive as a sandalwood base.  It\u2019s not sharp or screechy at all in the way that I fear orris/iris to sometimes be, but rather, it\u2019s so harmonious and easy to wear, it\u2019s really a flattering jack of all trades. It scratches my neverending itch for sweet fragrances while also offering orris in a lovely presentation that I find both comforting and easy to wear, along with narcissus, though the fragrance does not end up being overwhelmingly floral, so it\u2019s a recommended try.  Moreover, it performs well, like pretty much everything I\u2019ve tried from Sarah\u2019s catalogue, and good performance is always a plus.\n\r\nClouds Illusion (along with Clouds) is sold in the UK via the 4160 Tuesdays site and in the US via Krystal Fragrance.  The US pricing is $180 for 100ml / $120 for 50ml, very much in line with most of the line\u2019s pricing on this side of the Atlantic, and Clouds Illusion is a versatile fragrance with a high value, in my opinion.  It\u2019s frankly on my list to buy a backup bottle of at some point, because I really enjoy wearing a lot of it.\n\r\nI\u2019ve a sample of Clouds, as well (the parfum, I believe), so I\u2019ll need to give that a full try too, and report back, but from initially smelling the few different versions on paper, I can advise that while there are some differences among the four, all four are great.  I think Clouds Illusion EDP comes off as the lightest/freshest/brightest, but really, all of them are great and comparable, yet interesting in their own ways.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

The build up to the launch of Ristretto is that it incorporates more coffee than the original, the original being mostly vanilla and rose with a pinch of coffee, overall very close to Mancera Roses Vanille.\n\r\nRistretto does address this criticism of the original\u2014namely, that for its name, the original Intense Caf\u00e9 lacks coffee.  However, the coffee note in Ristretto is subtle, to my nose\u2014not a boastful, dense, dark-roast or espresso but rather a lattle, a medium-to-light, semi-milky note that mixes seamlessly with the vanilla.  Still, the rose and vanilla remain prominent and constitute the majority of the experience, but it\u2019s perhaps, say, an even split among the three main accords, as opposed to the vast majority of the original being made up of the vanilla and rose (and supporting notes) alone, vs. the coffee.\n\r\nUnlike most Montale and Mancera fragrances, the concentration of which is EDP, Ristretto Intense Cafe is extrait, and rather than the usual $180 for 100ml, Ristretto is priced at $215 for 100ml.  I do think the performance is improved, although the original always performed very well on me.  The addition of more coffee only thickens the blend, though, and that\u2019s a positive development, albeit at a premium of a 20% increase in retail cost.\n\r\nCertainly there\u2019s more coffee in Ristretto than in the original Intense Caf\u00e9, but enough to justify the price difference and purchasing a new bottle?  Doubtful, to me, as I get my coffee fix from other more coffee-intensive fragrances like Kerosene Follow, Dua Fragrances Caf\u00e9 Oud, Sebastiane Espresso Royale, and more recently for me, DSH Perfume Caf\u00e9 Noir.  Still, as a more balanced coffee/rose/vanilla option, Ristretto will fit the bill for many better than the original Intense Caf\u00e9.  Yet there are other coffee/rose options like Tom Ford Caf\u00e9 Rose that do the job, as well, albeit at a higher price.\n\r\nOverall, I love Ristretto, but roughly as much as I love the original Intense Caf\u00e9.  I just don\u2019t see the addition of some not-terribly-bold coffee as a vast improvement on the original.  It\u2019s a slight improvement, I\u2019d say, but only so much that I\u2019m content with the decant of Ristretto and my bottle of the original, still.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

Like the three previous creations\u2014Blyss, Grange, and Clutch\u2014L\u2019Ima is composed by perfumer Justin Frederico.\n\r\nTo me, L\u2019Ima is a wonderfully dry-but-not-terribly-tart, fresh composition that smells of mixed citruses and something along the lines of mixed petitigrains, predominantly, but it gets to the heart of the citrus\u2014not just the fruit, but the leaves and their layers. It really does smell of a garden but without being too green or too fruity. Tomato leaf factors in strongly as well in this sense. \n\r\nThere are also floral touches\u2014rose, lily, orris, geranium\u2014that add diversity, depth, and whiffs of sharpness that complement the fruity/vegetable dominance. And it all lands on a soft bed of copaiba balsam, amber, cashmere, sandalwood, and white musk.\n\r\nLooking from the notes alone, the formula seems excellent, and I\u2019d praise Nir\u2019s vision and Justin\u2019s skill for achieving yet another great creation that offers us something different from the line, a true summer fresh citrus but rather bold perfume. It offers a bright, enjoyable journey through citrus, primarily via a lime petitgrain type of dominance, but overall with a careful blend that feels well-crafted and thought out.\n\r\nOn my skin, it performs very well: its initial projection is boastful and its density is obvious, and with heat, it seems to come out even more. And at $95 for 50ml at full parfum strength (30% concentration), like the other perfumes from Perfumology, L\u2019Ima comes at a very reasonable price.\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend heading to Perfumology to give this a sniff or ordering a sample from the website.

I'm often not a fan of ginger, stated to the central note of the fragrance, since it sours a couple tobacco fragrances that I believe I would otherwise love (Phaedon Tabac Rouge, Roja Enigma/Creation-E), yet it does sometimes work wonderfully, as in Bleu de Chanel EDT.\n\r\nIn being mixed with vanilla and elemi, though, in a balanced way, its spiciness is not overwhelming. The mix of these accords seems rather balanced and with cedar and oak, two components also used in Grange, the blend is sort of year-round-friendly, warm, cozy creation, despite the imagery of driving out on the open road and smelling nature and smoke. Those elements for me are rather comforting, and I get some deja vu from Clutch without being able to put my finger on what exactly it reminds me of.\n\r\nPerformance-wise, it\u2019s strong on longevity but moderate on project, on par with Grange but a little bit denser, presumably do the use of heavier ingredients like vanilla. The pricing remains very reasonable , with Clutch, like its predecessors, offered in a 50ml size at extrait concentration for $95, on par with Imaginary Authors\u2019 pricing, for example.\n\r\nOverall, I laud Justin and NIr for this latest entry, perhaps edging out Grange as my favorite offering, and know I\u2019ll picking up a bottle of Clutch when it\u2019s restocked.

The balance is the same, I\u2019d say, among the principal notes, though: the orris/iris, vanilla, and narcissus.  The mix also features sandalwood and hay.  As with Illusion, Clouds is a revelation (to me) of how well with the powdery/creamy iris/orris can be mix with vanilla while keeping the mix feeling pleasantly balanced\u2014light, powdery, fresh, and sweet, all together, harmoniously. Again, Clouds is richer and denser than Clouds Illusion, which is brighter, slightly more fleeting, but still as interesting. \n\r\nThe Clouds collection was originally only available through the 4160 Tuesdays site as part of a crowdfunding effort led by Christi Long (of Eau My Soul).   That\u2019s how I came to know Clouds Illusion EDP first, as that\u2019s the bottle I chose during the crowdfunding campaign.  \n\r\nClouds and Clouds Illusions in their various forms seem to be sold out through most of the retailers, but I believe they\u2019ll make a comeback in new formulations and I look forward to their return.  I love both Clouds and Clouds Illusion and I imagine any future variations will also be excellent, high-performing, versatile juices.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

If you're familiar with an Indian crush, a cooked-down syrup of fruits (sometime with flowers and herbs) that's added to water to make a sweet drink - that's what this reminds me of.  Sweet and fruity and complicated with flowers and spices.\n\r\nGiven some time to dissect it, I think this is actually based on a clever fusion between tuberose and clove that only barely smells like either of them.  The tuberose is reduced to a sweet floral richness, while the clove is stripped down to a \"red\" spiciness.  Meanwhile, I'm guessing that jasmine is contributing sweetness while orange blossom gives a citric quality, with a pinch of cinnamon working with the clove to keep this from smelling like any specific flower.\n\r\nIt doesn't progress much, mostly getting less flowery and more orange-ish as the orange blossom takes over for the tuberose over the course of the day.  \n\r\nI generally don't care much for big fruity perfumes, so I'm voting neutral, but with the admission that I've had fun trying to mentally unwrap Los Angeles's clever smell.",

			"content": "No. Just no. This is literally the reason the niche perfume market has grown hand over foot compared to designers, particularly in the male market segment. You want a poster child for design-by-commitee paint-by-numbers \"scent for the young oblivious male that wants to get noticed and have a name on the bottle\" wrapped up in a perfectly unimaginative package? Better yet, you want a mixture of everything the B-list mall juices have been doing all swirled together into one AI-assisted technomage's elixer of antidepressant-fueled fake extroversion? Then my friend, you want Jimmy Choo Urban Hero (2019). God, where do I even begin? This stuff is like someone took the top to Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013), married it to the heart of Azzaro Wanted (2016), then set it on the base of Coach for Men (2017). Individually I enjoyed all three scents, but combined as a focus-group Frankenstein's monster, I get really confused. \n\r\nThe opening of Jimmy Choo Urban Hero is \"holy arsenal of aromachemicals Batman\" upon the nose. What even is \"lemon caviar\"? I get some nondescript mishmash of calone/galaxolide fruity floral muskiness that takes the breath away in the top, being that dryer sheets-meets-shampoo accord with hints of pink peppercorn to make it pop. Antoine Maisondieu is on this with Marion Costero, and it feels like they kept strictly to the low-budget brief passed down by the suits at Capri Holdings (who also own Michael Kors and Versace, with hierarchy between them going low to high in that order), delivering something made \"on autopilot\". The rosewood and vetiver claimed in the heart are buried in fruity chemical blah, and the base is thankfully a soft application of ambrox and the modern \"suede\" leather accord borrowed from Coach, but that's it. Wear time is a moderate 6 hours and sillage is also medium. To me, this feels like another clubber but with reduced volume.\n\r\nThe base being reigned in is the only redeeming quality of Jimmy Choo Urban Hero, but since it literally is a 50/50 take on Invictus and Coach for Men by this point, will just blend into the surroundings if worn at any nightlife hot spot. I don't recommend wearing Urban Hero to the office unless you want to be \"that guy\" everyone is suspicious is after their job, since this has the same \"notice me senpai\" vibe as a dozen others with similar bases from Viktor & Rolf, Salvador Ferragamo, Bvlgari, and so so many others who've copied the alpha male Invictus aesthetic to death. If you're the local \"Chad\" and you don't have the cash for Creed Aventus (2010) or the palette for Versace Eros (2012), this might be a considerable choice if you need a wall of facetious ingratiating olfaction to announce your arrival, but I don't know who else out there besides the modern equivalent to Patrick Bateman would want to wear this. Solid thumbs down but try before you take my word for it.\n\n",

The \u201ckey notes\u201d listed on the Kilian website seem reasonable and speak to the descriptors: almond milk, iris, and musk.   Beyond those, there\u2019s freesia, vanilla, and tonka, which mostly support the floral/powdery/creamy/sweet breakdown.\n\r\nRolling in Love strikes me as being marketed toward women but surely men who enjoy sweet and floral scents\u2014though this isn\u2019t overwhelmingly either\u2014it\u2019s a neat option, as it is for me.  It doesn\u2019t evolve much, as it frankly doesn\u2019t open up all that sharply: it has a good balance among the various elements\u2014especially the main three\u2014from opening to dry down.\n\r\nInterestingly enough, its retail pricing (at Saks, Nordstrom, etc.) is $240 for its standard 50ml refillable bottle, and this is cheaper than the retail for pretty much any other fragrance in the Kilian catalogue.  It\u2019s quite unusual for a new release to be priced below the rest of the pack.\n\r\nThis might be due to the main drawback of Rolling in Love, which is that it\u2019s not strikingly daring or unique, but rather, agreeable and familiar, but many are looking for the latter, for them, it\u2019ll work well, especially for women of all ages, I\u2019d say.  Personally, I\u2019d like a decant of this, but as it\u2019s a \u201clike\u201d not a \u201clove\u201d overall for me, I don\u2019t need a bottle.  Surely worthy of sampling by all, though, as it holds the balance well among the florals and gourmand notes.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Nothing special really and certainly not worth the inflated prices on Ebay, for a fragrance hyped by a few Youtube reviewers. Here's a REAL review..\n\r\nThe opening is awesome.. but very short lived. When I say short lived, I mean literally a couple seconds. There's this unique mandarin orange or nectarine sort of smell in the initial spray, and while it could be just a melange of chemicals, it likely isnt' since since it's a top note. I sense a hidden note of some sort of citrus that wouldn't last very long anyways, and in this case, lasting even less than ever. It then becomes an incense-driven, sweet vanillic aroma with balsamic undertones, almost teetering on niche style, but it quickly fades to a boring, very boring vanilla, tonka combo. Similar to the dry down of Eau des Baux at this point. This dries down very linear, and adds a little more incense back into the mix. The base notes are ok, but very faint. This is more of a top and middle fragrance.\n\r\nIt is a nice fragrance, but ever so boring and copied. I spoke to someone in the forum who found it close to Prada Luna Rossa Black, and while I see it may be in the same genre of gourmand vanilla, spicy, incense style frags, they are also very, very different. Luna Rossa Black (the much, much better of the 2 imo) goes more of a Midnight in Paris route, with the iris toned down, I think it's a gorgeous fragrance but performance is temperamental with it. While this may have better longevity, the base is really faint, and the smells are not even close. This is a creamy, sweet vanilla and tonka for the most part. The opening and middle are like a typical base of a lot of designer fragrances. Even by looking at the notes, with a top note of incense, one would question if this goes in reverse from the typical note pyramid.\n\r\nIf the price goes down to most Issey flankers, like 30 bucks, it'll be a great buy for anyone, even for me who is not particularly fond of it, but at over $100 a bottle, it's a big joke. \n\r\nNote: this would be a good fragrance for layering, if you're into that kinda thing.\n\r\nAdded findings: After wearing this more, I noticed a very strong amber dry down. Lots of amber. Sweet, creamy, almost vanilla amber.",

It\u2019s very pleasant and agreeable, and inherently a bit more suited for the colder weather that the more year-round-friendly Noir Argent, which has citrus and pepper.  Pulse of the Night is more like a Blvgari Man in Black in the sense that it blends several wintery elements together in a sweet/spicy mix.  Pulse is no doubt meant for mass appeal, and it achieves that very well while being interesting enough to pursue.\n\r\nLike Noir Argent, I quite like Pulse of the Night, overall.  It\u2019s more loyal to the \u201cNight\u201d in its name than the \u201cPulse\u201d and ends up being a workable, agreeable cold weather option, and a reasonable performer.  Overall, it\u2019s a fine everyday scent, apropos enough for the office or a night out, somewhere between casual and serious, in my opinion.\n\r\nThe retail pricing is still in effect but like most other flankers, there\u2019s reason to expect that it\u2019ll be within $50 for 100ml at some point, like 2018\u2019s Noir Argent now is on FragranceNet, for example.\n\r\n7 out of 10 \n",

But, just like 'The One', this fragrance is very soft, does not project very well and has poor longevity. And just like when I bought 'The One' and 'The One (EDP), I'm very disappointed. \n\r\nThe opening is nice and strong, a blast of citrus, berries and geranium which lasts for about 20 minutes before it settles into a very strange, cleaning products type of smell. The pimento and geranium mixed with blood orange just smells a bit 'off', like you spilled some household cleaner on yourself. This middle section lasts the longest time, but also kills the fragrance. It just doesn't work at all. The drydown and base is soft woods and patchouli, but by this time you can barely smell anything at all. \n\r\nTotal longevity, even testing with a dozen sprays (neck, chest, shoulders and wrists) is only about four hours, but after the first hour or so, this becomes a complete skin scent and doesn't project or linger at all. Spraying over clothes is a must for any type of sillage or longevity. Unless someone is hugging you or smelling your neck, no one will smell you. The only compliments I got was when I asked women to smell me directly where I sprayed this, and only within minutes of applying. Performance is just not there on this one. \n\r\nThe opening really grabs you in the store with its strong citrus, berries and geranium notes, so you end up buying it and taking it home only to be disappointed by its poor performance later when you give it a full wearing. Just like D&G's 'The One', YSL's 'Y' and plenty of other designer fragrances releases as of late. They release a weak, muted scent with poor performance but a great opening, and then years later release a stronger EDP or Intense flanker but even the 'stronger' flanker has average performance with about six hours longevity. \n\r\nMy guess is D&G will come out with a stronger 'K' (Intense) or 'K' (Eau de Parfum) flanker eventually, which is the version they should have released in the first place instead of this weak skin scent. If this were priced at $30 and under, it could sell all day everyday. But at nearly $100 for 100ml, this is complete garbage. Look for this at your nearest discounters very soon for less than half of retail prices, and even that would be too expensive for this fragrance.\n\r\nThe only place I see this being 'King' is in a close indoor office environment, because it's so soft it won't offend anyone, but it also won't gather compliments either. So if you want to be 'King' of the office by smelling like household cleaning solution, grab this. Otherwise, I don't recommend this at all. ",

			"content": "It has been well over a decade since the previous masculine pillar from Dolce & Gabbana was released, and in the time between, the house has unapologetically abused flankers both seasonal and semi-permanent to the point of losing confidence among enthusiasts in the brand's ability to do something truly new. Well, K by Dolce & Gabbana (2019) still isn't exactly something that will inspire confidence, but at least it's an idea standing on its own two feet rather than living in the shadows of past glory as a forgettable flanker. Making a new scent into a pillar statement for a new line has an \"all eyes on me\" effect that extremely staid and complacent designers would rather avoid when wanting to stay relevant without taking risks (looking at you Dolce & Gabbana), but unlike Chanel, most houses can't safely extend a line for a decade due to the quality or uniqueness of the scent profile. When they want something \"new\" but also want to avoid grinding out R&D dollars for a new line every few years like the glory days of the 1970's and 1980's, flankers happen. Dolce & Gabbana seemed particularly addicted to them in recent years, but have finally decided to \"bite the bullet\" with K, and almost like an agoraphobic person trying to step outside their door, take only the slightest bit of \"daring\" in the approach, mixing it with their usual security blanket of freshness. Fortunately for them, K rather works as a modern office-friendly masculine, if you can get past the gaudy packaging. The bottle which houses K isn't all that bad, but a plastic crown adorns the cap, recalling the themed shtick that Avon used to employ in the mid-20th century. This kind of kitsch can be a real turn-off to the \"take myself seriously\" cologne bro that reads GQ Magazine like the King James bible, but for you collectors out there, this is a little dollop of tongue-and-cheek personality that adds flavor to a lineup otherwise consisting of squares and domes. The packaging only feigns decadence though, as little about K seems truly rich.\n\r\nThe scent of K is an interesting and unexpected mishmash of modern barbershop values like Prada Luna Rossa Carbon (2017) and modern citrus woody chypres a la Creed Aventus (2010) or Mancera Cedrat Boise (2011). Some also are comparing this to Office for Men by Fragrance One (2019) from YouTube influencer Jeremy Fragrance, but considering the lane all these scents drive in, it's expected. The opening is the harshest and most challenging part, and also most-comparable to Office for Men, with blood orange and a bright lemon get pressed between juniper berry and bergamot, creating a \"mothballs\" kind of salvo. Soon this olfactive assault shifts and the juniper mixes with some pimento as the heart emerges. This next phase is probably the most daring part of the scent profile, since semi-sweet juniper and spicy pimento coexist alongside a barbershop profile of lavandin, geranium, and clary sage, recalling 90's fresh foug\u00e8res and establishing the office-friendly vibe but with that extra territorial marking of pimento. The base is the usual synthetic norlimbanol and Iso E dry woods but I don't get any ambroxan/ambergris vibes from this, with a dry patchouli and vetiver doing the talking late in the wear similar to Terre d'Herm\u00e8s (2008) alongside the woody aromachemicals, minus and mineralic notes of course. Yup, this is a good ol' exercise in basic citrus woody accords and outside the aforementioned norlimbanol (which is standing in as cedar) and usual suspects like linalool, the amount of foghorn chemical notes here is kept minimum. While not whisper quiet, this does make K by Dolce & Gabbana more discrete than the average ambroxan bomb, meaning \"power users\" may complain about projection. I think it's fine, and has more than enough longevity for the work day, which is where this is meant to be used. Very little about K surprises or excites the seasoned hobbyist, but very little about it offends either outside maybe the napalm opening. \n\r\nLike Gucci Guilty for Men (2011) and Prada Luna Rossa (2012), K is a fairly neutral scent with a little \"something something\" to make it stand apart from the floods of Bleu de Chanel (2010), Paco Rabanne Invictus (2012), and Dior Sauvage (2015) one is likely to encounter in the corporate setting (until the Creeds and MFKs start coming out to play on the executive floors), but it isn't artistic enough for the hardcore \"fraghead\" already knee-deep in vintage or niche selections. There are certainly a lot nicer things at higher price points and those recurring whiffs of pimento and blood orange won't be for everyone, but a combination of tradition, trend, and \"x factor\" is more or less just what Dolce & Gabbana needed to avoid the hangman's noose in the male sector. This isn't by a longshot Nathalie Lorson's nor Daphne Bugey's finest hour as perfumers, but when dealing with the first new masculine pillar in over a decade from a brand notorious for resting on their laurels since the 2000's, things could have been a whole lot worse. K almost had to be a paradox of provocative advertising and semi-safe composition, with just the right amount of edge to be \"cool\", because this is the formula that sells perfume to the average upper middle-class Western male these days, and anything else would have been a gross disappointment to their market, so they'd rather not risk making a genuine \"statement\" fragrance like the discontinued ones they made in the 90's. The more I wear K the more I wonder what they'll do with the base character of it in inevitable future eau de parfum concentrations or sport flankers, and now we come full circle. K by Dolce & Gabbana is a solid, no-frills modern aromatic with a twist that won't be a go-to for fans of exotica, but is a good potential workhorse for the more-pragmatic user looking to step one foot outside the circle of normality with their signature scent.

			"content": "Every now and then, I smell something like this that gives me a jolt.  But these days, I wait and see if my mind spits out a duplicate warning.  Rose et Cuir by Frederic Malle is a big geranium-ash-leather bomb that immediately smells arresting to me, chock full of the bitter, crushed-stem greenery of Mediterranean kitchen garden scents like Un Jardin en M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e by Hermes, or the opening of L\u2019Ombre dans L\u2019 Eau by Diptyque minus that scent\u2019s screechy, burnt-jam rose that ruins the rest of the composition.\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t bother me that I was able to \u2018scent match\u2019 the front half of Rose et Cuir so quickly, because a) the green topnotes are, for me, an improvement over what had gone before, and b) an interesting overlay of record vinyl, condom rubber, and cigarette ash rescues the greenery from the sort of simple naturalism that\u2019s always affecting at first but eventually boring.\n\r\nWithout looking at the reviews, the second half was a challenge to place, but place it I eventually did.  Cabochard de Gr\u00e8s.  Voila.  If you like the peculiarly ashy, meaty, acrid bitterness of that Cellier-esque leather (\u00e0 la Bandit et al), then you\u2019ll be in seventh heaven.  Me?  I can quite happily go without.  Interestingly, though, despite the clear references, Cuir et Rose doesn\u2019t feel derivative or jaded.  It\u2019s a gutsy fragrance that doesn\u2019t feel particularly Ellena-esque (nothing \u2018watercolor\u2019 about it).  Actually, it\u2019s downright grimy.\n\r\nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t cheat and take a look at the reviews for Rose et Cuir first, because since everyone and their cat identified the main building blocks of the scent right away, I can\u2019t be sure that my nose would have landed on the right reference on its own.  Because sometimes, you know, I see words like \u2018ashy\u2019 or \u2018rosy\u2019 or \u2018metallic\u2019 and I start to smell it that way too, even if my own nose says otherwise.  The truth is, I\u2019m very open to suggestion.  ",

Hermes would never release something with the chemical-leqther isobutyl quiloline (gasp!)\n\r\nAnyway. There is no rose in here. Elena has used a mixture of leaves, stems, and blackcurrant. It's an impression of a rose at a very specific time in its lifetime. A nice illusion, but only that. \n\r\nWhen that Diptyque-Baies-diluted-10x-topnote finally morphes into a drydown, it's a beautiful balance of chemical (Bandit), the harsh green aspect of the top/heart notes (Gentiane Blanche) and a slight licorice-y element.

			"content": "Love conquers all\n\r\nIt is difficult to write about Rose and Cuir without considering its nose and the history that comes before it. Its very name is suggestive of Jean-Claude Ellena\u2019s Hermessences, a line for Herm\u00e8s that epitomizes the minimalist style he is best known for, a number of which were named after two contrasting ingredients, \"Vetiver Tonka,\" \"Epice Marine,\" and so on. However, if Rose and Cuir\u2019s name and short ingredients list have left you hoping for another light-wearing and pared-down \u201colfactory haiku,\u201d it will surprize.\n\r\nRose and Cuir is a forceful fragrance. It opens with a bright, fresh rose briefly rounded out with berries and then heightened by pepper. After about fifteen minutes or so, the IsoButyl Quinoline kicks in. If you are unfamiliar with the note, think of the fantastically bitter and smoky opening of Bandit. This eventually dominates the scent. For a couple hours following, Rose and Cuir remains a harsh leather wherein the rose and other notes like vetiver all play a supporting role. On one wearing, the aggressive gasoline tinge of the leather became so commanding, the rose was barely discernible, and yet it still provided a major tempering influence to the leather\u2019s brusqueness. It\u2019s like the cinnamon in your chili. You\u2019d never guess it was there but you\u2019d immediately notice if it was forgotten.\n\r\nThe scent slowly shifts its emphasis in the dry down. By the third hour, it is perceptibly a rose geranium and berry infused leather. And it is very much rose _geranium_. By the fifth hour, the floral note has come to the fore as the leather recedes to serve as a smoky foundation.\n\r\nIt\u2019s a ballsy move to present a harsh note like IsoButyl Quinoline in such a pared down perfume. Take Bandit, which has a lot going on, adding creamy tuberose, animalistic musks and a symphonic host of other notes as a counterweight. It\u2019s an elabourate costume, the whole nine yards of SM leather: the cage harness, the overbust corset, the skin tight pants, the lace up thigh high boots. If Rose and Cuir is a domme like Bandit, she\u2019s waxed every inch of her body and is wearing naught but a pair of Louboutin So Kate stilettos. While tapping the ashes of her cigarette onto your tongue.\n\r\nIf you can set aside your expectations of watercolour transparency that typifies Ellena\u2019s previous fragrances, you will find the simplicity and dynamism of the Hermessences is still evident with Rose and Cuir. Here, Ellena has paired two contrasting notes and let them play off each other. Rose is luminous and uplifting, guileless and sanguine; Cuir is sharp with shadows, dangerous and brooding. But if this is a haiku, it is not one of serene, zen-like contemplation, but of stark, noire-ish drama.\n\r\nPersonally, I adore the bitterness of IsoButyl Quinoline but I\u2019m a maximalist at heart and I already have Bandit. Rose and Cuir will probably prove to be too challenging to rank among Malle\u2019s more commercially successful perfumes but I am so glad it exists. Bravo!",

The mental image I was slammed with for the next several hours was that of a large orchestra, all tuning their individual instruments with the volume knob at 11.  That was 6 weeks ago.\n\r\nIn an effort to better understand it, I\u2019m writing this review with a single drop on the back of my hand.  Within the first 10 minutes, I\u2019m finding the top notes of black current, neroli and mandarin are unable to assert themselves with any impact, pushed rudely aside by jasmine and a strong, soapy lavender.  60 minutes later the screechy aspect seems to be slowly backing down, a touch of warmth tentatively rising to the surface.  I\u2019m hoping for vanilla but I have my doubts.\n\r\nCedar and vanilla blend well toward the 3 hour mark and the shrieking aspect has subsided.  A faint, vague sweetness has emerged at 5 hours, but zero projection, I am pressing my nose to my hand now.  The lavender is still present but now just a barely audible hum.\n\r\nFinal thoughts:  The drydown is enjoyable but I\u2019m unwilling to tolerate the fragrance to get there.  Because it has a long finish that smooths out significantly better than I originally predicted, I feel it\u2019s only fair to offer a neutral rating. \n\n",

			"content": "Yves Saint Laurent decided to do something a bit risky for a change with Libre (2019), by taking a genre typically the realm of mainstream masculine tropes and subverting it for the feminine market. In actuality, this isn't all that new of an idea, as \"tomboyish\" feminines have perennially cropped up in the market since the advent of separate genders in the mainstream fragrance world way back when the first \"Pour Homme/Pour Monsieur/For Men\" scents hit the shelves. In this instance, we're getting a feminine market iteration of the lavender foug\u00e8re, but obviously not on the direct level of something like Dana's Ambush (1955), which itself was a retooling of Dana Canoe (1936) by the same perfumer. Instead, Libre borrows a bit here and there from masculines of the recent past by Yves Saint Laurent, taking the woody synthetic amber base from Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme (2006) and the sweet lavender from the flanker La Nuit de L'Homme (2009), mixing in the ambrox elements of Yves Saint Laurent Y Eau de Parfum (2018), then padding it out with notes more congruent with the mainstream idea of the feminine scent palate. The results of this mad science project from perfumers Ann Flipo and Carlos Benaim is pretty good, rather sexually ambiguous (as to be expected), but ultimately not so exciting. This is a comfort food scent that can realistically be worn by anyone but swaddled in iconography meant to have feminine appeal. \n\r\nThe opening is mandarin, petitgrain, lavender, and juicy blackcurrant. The lavender and petitgrain strike right away as a barbershop accord most familiar with mature men who wear things like Creed Bois du Portugal (1987), but a sweet orange blossom and jasmine enter into the heart, where the lavender lasts from the top to join them. Here, Libre becomes closer to a unisex and powdery clean sort of foug\u00e8re accord similar to cK Be by Calvin Klein (1996), but without the tart peach note. The heart of the scent throbs with lavender, orange blossom, jasmine, and a warmth powered by the glow of its powdery musky base, which isn't readily apparent until this has set on skin for a good thirty minutes or so. Amber and ambergris notes pack a one-two punch of warmth smoothed out into a vanilla glow, meaning Yves Saint Laurent is striving for something of a modern Guerlain approach with a cozy blended vanilla but this is no Mon Guerlain (2017) clone. I normally try not to use synthetic itself as a synonym for \"bad\", but here the obvious artifice of the blunt-force vanilla note in Libre is the one part that reminds you what YSL is willing to spend on it's non-prestige lines anymore. Overall, this is good, if a bit homely to those used to more sophisticated perfumes. The only bit of controversy in this is the fact that the foug\u00e8re accord itself has been reclaimed for a market that traditionally has avoided it for the better part of a century, but there is nothing else really daring about it, and this lacks any oakmoss or evernyl so it technically is only near-foug\u00e8re by definition.\n\r\nI'd say as a romantic spring and fall scent, Libre would be a charmer in a setting where a quiet dinner out or night window shopping is in order. Libre is too soft spoken for a club or a formal gathering, even if it does has a nice long wear time of about 10 hours. Since this does have some rough edges in the base, niche aficionados may not approve, but that's not the market this is after methinks. Women looking for something not so sweet as a gourmand and not sharp like a chypre will love this, while men liking foug\u00e8re accords and unafraid of a little gender bending will warm right up to it. This stuff has a lot of transgender potential as well, because it really does smell like it is all about being free like the marketing states and not bound to gender norms, despite the fact that it is ironically pitched to women instead of being labelled unisex. There was a much earlier Eau Libre (1975) by Yves Saint Laurent that shared many of the notes this one does, but had a chypre base and aldehydes in the top. This may very well be a spiritual successor of sorts outside the obvious genre and gender marketing differences, but regardless is a friendly smile of a lavender scent that is really hard for anyone to dislike. Sample before you buy because the vanilla dries differently on various skin compositions, and personal chemistry on Libre plays a bigger part than with some perfumes because of it, or just wear it on the shirt and never mind any of that. Thumbs up. ",

			"content": "What do you get when you take Yves Saint Laurent Y Eau de Parfum (2018) and stuff it full of fruity sweetness, cranking up the orange blossom like typical Gucci Guilty Pour Homme (2011), then shove a bunch of shampoo/shower gel notes like Paco Rabanne Invictus (2013), then dime the knobs on projection to Versace Eros (2013) levels? Why, you get Y Live by Yves Saint Laurent (2019) of course! I can sort of see the appeal for having a Y for Men (2017) flanker tweaked with elements of the aforementioned EdP but made more club-friendly and youth-oriented, since capturing that upper middle-class teen impulse shopper who won't use his dad's Bleu de Chanel (2010) is the only way most other designers are survivng in a world of niche and prestige perfumes invading department store counters. However, Yves Saint Laurent is really grasping at straws here because the original 2017 eau de toilette was already pretty youth-friendly to begin with in that crisp white shirt Nautica kind of way, while the EdP took all the harsh norlimbanol scratch away to make something more respectable as a generalist office scent someone over 30 wouldn't be embarassed to wear, but where does an extra-youthful version of the EdP really fit in? I'm not sure I can really answer the above question, but what I can say is this smells like Dominique Ropion almost entirely composed Y Live by prescription from market analyists.\n\r\nWhat those analyists were likely saying is that what the market needed was a less-mature version of the EdP (which already wasn't very formal if at all), so with a huge sigh of disappointment, here comes the notes. Sweet grapefruit, pear, and ginger open the top, sitting somewhere between Azzaro Wanted (2016), the aforementioned Invictus, and the opening from the Y EdP but mixed in an early 2000's way. The orange blossom and geranium almost seems to bond with ambroxan on an atomic level in the heart, which is where most of the clubber-friendly projection stems, although it doesn't quite burn the eyeballs like the original Y EdT. The base is the usual tonka Kool-Aid patchouli and laundry musk with woody aromachemical scratch, and some of the saltiness of the EdP left over to link back to the rest of the line, but it's a real mess when it dries. This fancies itself as some kind of cold weather gourmand hybrid in the note breakdown, but lacks the claimed juniper or cocoa notes in the final stages to really be that at all. Y Live smells like someone made a mashup of every Montblanc Legend (2011) and Jimmy Choo Man (2014) flanker on the market and gave the resulting beast a glaze of Y EdP to help connect the dots. Y Live is an \"Eau de Toilette Intense\", so with extra-projection to get the job of destroying your sanity done, it comes on like a bull in a china closet and overstays its welcome until scrubbed.\n\r\nY Live by Yves Saint Laurent ends up competing with Viktor & Rolf Spice Bomb Night Vision (2019) and Acqua di Gi\u00f2 Absolu Instinct (2019) for the title of the most unnecessarily-loud and insipid flanker of 2019. The well must be really running dry over there at Yves Saint Laurent, and more over the designer masculine perfume market at large for so many samey fruitchouli Kool-Aid ambroxan bombs with absolutely zero sense of identity being spewed forth onto shelves with such reckless abandon. Here I thought nothing would top Jimmy Choo Urban Hero (2019) for being the nadir of abusing trend, but not even the pretty face of Adam Levine on the ads for this stuff can save it from being the epitome of high-volume mediocrity, because why would even a completely indiscriminate mainstream perfume buyer choose this over the more-recognizable Invictus or even Dior Sauvage (2015) since it smells like everything yet nothing at once, with probably the most-annoying combination of mass-market accords yet assembled? Go test it if you want to, but don't go out of your way since there is nothing here you haven't smelled before and done better elsewhere. If you like the EdP as I do, just stick with that, since it's sweet enough to handle a night out but actually has some decent balance and warmth without smelling like it wants your phone number.

I love marine life, and thought it was a long time coming (and that they should make more of them!).\n\r\nI definitely get the ink here. Something about this is decidedly \"viscous\". It's not light or refreshing like Acqua di Gio or a host of other aquatics, this is dark abyssal water. There aren't any blue resins out there to my knowledge, but that's the impression I get. Rich, smooth, dark blue resin.\n\r\nI wouldn't describe it as a particularly bombastic scent. It's well-made and evokes the Squid imagery well, but it's actually pretty laid back. A squid is muted in terms of personality, stoic and aloof, and I feel the same way about this scent, so I guess it's pretty appropriate. Maybe it's just that I'm coming from the blood and chaos of wearing T-Rex yesterday. This is certainly wearable, and is a bit softer projection wise. For now it's quite pleasant but not a favorite. However, I definitely want to sit with this one a bit longer. I have a feeling it will grow on me.",

The marine aspect is quite different from the usual, hinting at a sumptuous meal of 'fruits de la mer' served in the elegant surroundings of the Nautilus by the gracious host, Captain Nemo.\n\r\nSomehow the atmosphere aboard that tastefully furnished vessel is conjured up in this highly original fragrance, a refreshing change from the usual ocean breeze and tropical flower compositions. The avant garde elements seem to be concentrated in the topnotes, where they can be best appreciated by the wearer as they apply the fragrance.\n\r\nThe main body of the perfume bears a distant resemblance to Bulgari Black, which is perhaps where the reference to black ink comes in. There is a black tar and oily aspect, nothing so crude as cod liver oil though that idea did come briefly to mind, but it's more like a pleasant effluvium from the deep sea equipment.\n\r\nAs Elena Knezhevich of Fragrantica puts it \"Zoologist Squid sings a song of the sea, a melancholy tale told through tangy brine... all united by the moody aroma of ambergris...\" ",

Like spray from a boat misting your face...it has a slight smell, and I think Squid captures that. It's not coastal briney, barnacled, seaweedy or fishy, as some hardcore aquatics try to be. It's not a grungy pier, and doesn't smell much like a seashore. The mental imagery for me is clean, bright, seawater: open ocean. There's an \"ink\" note, but not sure I'd call it squid ink, which smells pretty fishy in cuisine. Just ink, and it combines well with the mineralism of the seawater note, and highlights the imagery of bottomless, clear seawater on a sunny say...that wonderful deep color.\n\r\nThe structural backdrop is basically bright spices (apparently pink pepper and opoponax, though I wouldn't be able to peg them without referencing the pyramid), and a clean, dry sort of mineral amber accord, likely from the benzoin. The sillage has a surprisingly smooth warmth to it, and up close you get the salty, inky stuff.\n\r\nA really impressive composition...unique yet very wearable, particular with that inviting sillage. Some might find it a little boring, but I think it's good to see Zoologist exploring more approachable territory while stay true to itself. Could easily be a summer staple.",

The floral blend has a perfect floral arc that starts lightly with mild Lily of Valley, gentle Magnolia then resonates with a Tuberose crescendo over a surface of uplifting Ylang.  The deer musk adds a soft dry fuzzy muskiness that slows the floral roll with sandalwood and guaiac wood serving as an invisible stop.

So whilst the grapefruit made an appearance, it does not stand out.  \n\r\nThe drydown sees a strengthening of the spicy component, with whiffs of black pepper and, in particular, a good nutmeg impression developing; the latter is quite dark and rich, as the whole mix is now losing the brightness that characterised it at the beginning.  \n\r\nThe base still has a touch of the vetiver lingering on.  This vetiver has always been on the darker side, quite smooth with a bit of earthiness but minimal harshness on me.  It peters out now, being replaced by a dark but smooth patchouli that expresses a touch of crispness.   There is a wood accord in the background too, with a bit of cedar at times but mostly a bit nonspecific.  \n\r\nI get moderate sillage, good projection and six hours of longevity on my skin, with the last hours quite close to the latter.  \n\r\nThis very nice scent for warmer autumn days is at its best during the  first half of its development, with the ingredients being of very good quality.

			"content": "Molton Brown is admittedly more well known for their high-end shower gels than their perfumes, but they seek to change that, and have repackaged as well as introduced new perfume lines that sell in an entry-level niche price bracket, undoubtedly to scoop up on some of \"that money\" while the getting is good. Flora Luminare (2019) is one such scent and is almost exclusive to the Neiman Marcus chain in the US, while back in their home turf of the UK are sort of in the same train of thought as a Jo Malone or Penhaligon's (both brands also marketed as more upscale in the US). Flora Luminare is made in eau de parfum and eau de toilette, both with a few key differences mostly in the base notes of bitter almond, mate, frankincense, and sandalwood being in the EdP to make it rounder and warmer, while frangipani is present in the otherwise more-transparent EdT. I honestly prefer the EdT over the EdP, as the heavier version of this stuff takes the focus too far away from the florals, but your opinion may differ after comparison.\n\r\nThe opening of Flora Luminare is roughly the same for both versions save the bitter almond and petitgrain in the EdP. Otherwise, you're getting hedionic jasmine, neroli, and ylang-ylang in perfect white floral harmony, just with less sweetness in the EdP. The heart of EdP is rose, mate, and vanilla, while the EdT goes with rose, gardenia, frangipani, and has a much cleaner feeling, better for summer or after a shower. The base of the EdP goes down the incense and woods route, becoming something \"oriental lite\" which is boring when you consider stuff like Shalimar (1925) still stalks the earth, but the EdT has a nice dry cedar, white musk, and light mossiness that gives it a natural feeling similar to a Diptyque floral. Fans of Ol\u00e8ne (1988) or Do Son (2005) will find favor in the EdT of Flora Luminare. Wear time is a bit low at 6 hours but the sillage wafts to and fro fairly effortlessly in that time with the EdT, while the EdP has much better performance all around but is too nondescript to be enjoyable. \n\r\nFlora Luminare is a nice floral song and dance that seems simple yet satisfying if you're into the eau de toilette version, but goes down a bit of a lost path in its richer Eau de Parfum form, and I feel maybe the accord from the EdT should just have overall been beefed up like Diptyque often does with it's EdP versions of classic florals, rather than be so drastically re-orchestrated into something it cannot sustain. Never have two different version of a perfume gotten me so conflicted and since they exist in a single entry I'll have to parse the two in my judgment. I would give a thumbs down to the EdP but a thumbs up to the EdT, so in this case I'll just spit out a neutral rating as an average of the two. This may seem grossly unfair to some, but I'm not given a choice when they exist as one both by the house and by most websites that list them. Sample and reach your own conclusion, as you may love or hate them both. As for me? I'll likely stick to the shower gel unless I fall in love with something else from the line. ",

			"content": "Here we have another sort of genre experiment in the white-clad \"Soleil\" sub-line of the Private Blend collection. This time, we get semi-futuristic synthetic floral showcasing a dark Turkish rose and jasmine blend that lacks any of the sultry indole or Gothic overtones this combination usually possesses, almost as if Tom Ford sought to make a \"neutered\" version of a heady Turkish rose scent safe for all the upper-class Karens to wear when they insist on speaking to your manager. I am a sucker for rose perfumes, but unlike Noir de Noir (2007) or Cafe Rose (2012), I don't know if I can bring myself to fully endorse what Tom Ford has done here. Of interesting note, carrot seed makes an appearance here, and it adds a pseudo-violet tone to reinforce the overall floral tone, but otherwise doesn't really stand out. Soleil Neige (2019) draws in curiosity but because of the deliberate adultery going on, is not destined to be a favorite among niche heads who are usually fans of the line, nor is it straightforward enough for hardcore rose fans.\n\r\nThe opening of Soleil Neige (2019) is bergamot and that aforementioned carrot seed, but moments later the Turkish rose hits and establishes that yes, this is another dark-ish rose-focused Tom Ford Private Blend. However, unlike the others, we don't get a rich confectionary patchouli rose or dry gothic rose thanks to the lack of any such supporting elements to get us there in the olfactive sense. Yeah, there is jasmine, but it's hedionic in nature and flanked with neroli. Something called \"karmaflor\" (by Givaudan) also makes a show, and is in the same train of thought as IFF's \"karmawood\" in that it presents a wholly synthetic aroma meant to mimic something in nature, being flowers this time instead of wood. The karmaflor adds an interesting mix between lily of the valley and frangipani to the mix, but is so dialed down as not to disturb the rose. Labdanum, musk, benzoin, and vanilla provide the usual \"floriental\" base Tom Ford is so fond of, just with a much lighter scent riding on top. Wear time is all day and sillage is deceptively high for something that presents itself as gentle and transparent upon initial inspection, but as a tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of tropes (another Tom Ford-ism), I also am not surprised. If this kind of thing is your cup, I imagine it would wear well almost anywhere, and is pretty versatile for rich rose scent. \n\r\nAs mentioned, the Karens of the world will undoubtedly like the \"expensive smelling\" but mostly safe progression of clean citrus into rose then semi-creamy base notes, with the fact that a characteristically dark rose is standing in for the usual tea rose or Bulgarian rose totally lost on them. Perfume aficionados that know their roses will find this little number to be an odd exercise in \"can we do it but should we do it\", although I don't see that amounting to a bunch of sales for Tom Ford because there are just better executions of Turkish rose. To me, this is like making a whiskey sour with a really rare and deep vintage spirit rather than the usual well-grade whiskey you find at bars. Sure, it'll taste like a whiskey sour with an added bit of depth from having an uncommon ingredient, but what you've really done is intentionally underutilized your ingredients in a senseless display of decadence. Most Tom Ford Private Blend scents are just that anyway, so I guess I'm not really telling you something you don't already know. Soleil Neige is a neat little curiosity, but not worth the steep price for admission at only 50ml per bottle. Neutral. ",

There\u2019s some citrus hints (bergamot, orange blossom), but not much fruitiness, further distancing it from seemingly being crafted for the summer, despite being fairly light as it dries down into a mix of florals (jasmine, rose) and a smooth base of labdanum, benzoin, vanilla, and musk.  \n\r\nIt definitely feels most appropriate as a daytime wear, and while having feminine touches, is fairly unisex, overall.

As soon as I sniffed it on skin, I knew I had to have a bottle.\n\r\nAm\u00e9rique paints a lovely, woody-spicy-green vision of the American frontier, like beams of light breaking between the trees of a dense forest. In this creation, perfumer Michael Loring Probst tips his hat to the fougeres and powerhouses of days of yore, but this has an impression of cleanliness that still keeps it quite contemporary.\n\r\nIt's an essentially straightforward ride through spicy, citrus-tinged woods, starting dark but transitioning to a slight, mellow sweetness the longer it wears on the skin. This Am\u00e9rique feels a bit like how Houbigant Foug\u00e8re Royale might feel if it had to be reconstructed and rebalanced without lavender.\n\r\nAm\u00e9rique is dignified and masculine, a little more casual than formal, but there's nothing particularly \"occasional\" about this very natural-feeling blend of ingredients. It's sold in EDT concentration only, but it lasts plenty long (7 or so hours), and it projects fairly well (I've often found with Third West Brand scents that they tend to get louder after initial application).",

Pine is the most obvious smell, with some sort of herbal green smell underneath that contributes a grassy base for the pine.

Meanwhile, a touch of Iso E Super adds a whiff of smoke to the sillage.\n\r\nUltimately, it's the synthetic sweetness that's kept me from really liking Yoyogi, though if you're a fan of wood scents who's getting sick of all the burnt campfire darkness that's taken over the genre, this may be a new favorite.",

I bought Swiss Alps because I was looking for something exceptionally crisp, fresh, and chilly...like the mountain air I'd expect to encounter there. But with the exception of a fir and pine accord, there was little to be found in that upper, airy, cool and crisp register. The fragrance felt kind of heavy...soggy. And because of the heaviness its smell just sort of hangs there. After a while it gets annoying. T I'm not sure why tonka was used here--it's not a note I associate with high, bracing altitudes, and paired with orchid and lily, things move in another extraneous direction I'd prefer to avoid. Silver Mountain Water, Humiecki & Graef Eau Radieuse...these fragrances convey the cold, invigorating air that might surround a tall mountain. L'Air du Alpes Suisse does not. Unfortunately, this was just a mediocre release by Tauer, and I definitely caution against buying it blindly. This was one particular scent that I really just wanted to get off of myself quickly.

By pure chance I also tried the new 19-69 fragrance Female Christ which has many of the same notes I find here.    L'Air des Alpes Suisses is very unisex and smells like a traditional alpine meadow perfume sachet that used to hide away inside clothing drawers.  I have given this a neutral rating because compared to the stellar originality of other Tauer fragrances, this effort is quite average.

The main standout notes to me are lavender, lemon, ambergris, birch, lily, rosewood, and nutmeg, with a handful of others.  It\u2019s a complex composition but the result is pleasant and fairly easy to wear, a year-round jack-of-all-trades that has freshness but not to the point of being bland or generic.\n\r\nI conclude that while Andy is not reinventing the wheel with these, it\u2019s nonetheless a special twist on a familiar fresh spicy DNA that he makes his own, highly wearable and enjoyable and a bottle I\u2019ll seriously need to consider buying.\n\r\nIt comes in EDT concentration but feels like a comfortably moderate performer, not too airy nor pulling a disappearing act like many freshies, but certainly not as dense or rich as say, a Profumuma Roma fresh offering, with its high oil content.\n\r\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s in stock currently at Perfumology but other US boutiques like Luckyscent and Tigerlily  carry it at its retail pricing of $135 for 50ml, in line with house\u2019s pricing for most fragrances.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Oeilleres opens with a camphoraceous eucalyptus underpinned by aromatic lavender before moving to its heart.  As the composition enters its early heart, the eucalyptus remains, now joined by significant natural smelling cumin spice and a strong, almost mossy olive-oil accord supported by slightly herbaceous chamomile.  During the late dry-down, the olive oil accord recedes then disappears, as does the cumin spice, unveiling a woody, leathery styrax base note, with hints of supporting soft musk through the finish.  Projection is excellent, as is longevity at around 11-12 hours on skin.\n\r\nOeilleres is a tough composition to describe.  There are a lot of floral components, but the composition does not smell floral at all.  In truth the primary standouts begin with cumin spice that thankfully does not present itself like body odor as in many other compositions, instead coming off quite natural smelling, like one might expect to find in a spice cabinet.  Another is what can best be described as an \"olive oil\" accord, quite similar to the one frequently found in most of the early O'driu releases by Angelo Orazio Pregoni.  There is a moss-like characteristic that melds with the olive oil accord, but this is not oakmoss instead presenting closer to the smell of tree moss or maybe a synthetic version of it. Finally, the styrax (benzoin) does not present itself as balsamic and floral as it frequently does, but rather as almost a cedar wood and leather hybrid undertone that works quite well during the late dry-down.  While describing Oeilleres is difficult, deciding whether the end result works is much easier, and the answer is definitely \"yes.\"  I doubt this is a composition one would reach for often, but outside of the extremely limited edition (and availability) O'driu releases you would be hard-pressed to find anything on the market similar.  The bottom line is that while the $215 per 50ml bottle Oeilleres is a bit of an oddball offering that will not garner mainstream attention, the \"very good\" to \"excellent\" 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5 rated release will surely appeal to and is recommended to perfume enthusiasts who dig Odriu's early offerings and/or find their tastes bent to the more inventive side of the spectrum.",

			"content": "Dior seems to be in the habit of running all their more-recent or best-selling masculines through permutations of eau de toilette, eau de parfum, and parfum, which is a model they have shamelessly copied from Chanel, a house having traditionally done this for their feminine fragrances but began doing it with great success for the masculine Bleu de Chanel (2010) line as well. Likewise, Dior has sent everything from Eau Sauvage (1966) and Fahrenheit (1989) to Dior Homme (2005) down this path, so it was only a matter of time before their watershed masculine Sauvage (2015) got the same treatment. The eau de parfum variant of Sauvage released in 2018 almost in response to the Bleu de Chanel Parfum (2018), the third and most intense version of Chanel's flagship male fragrance, and now releases Sauvage Parfum (2019) to give Dior's flagship the same 3 choices as Chanel. Sauvage Eau de Parfum (2018) was an ammendment of sorts to the synthetic bombast of the original eau de toilette, a refinement for more moderate palettes making a more natural-smelling scent profile. However, this parfum iteration is altogether a different animal from either previous version and behaves like it has had all the fight beaten out of it, and that's something I wasn't expecting. \n\r\nThe primary difference between Sauvage Parfum and either previous concentrations of the scent is the total lack of edge in the top notes, and a beefed-up pseudo-foug\u00e8re base underneath it all. Perfumer Fran\u00e7ois Demachy has greatly toned down the vacuum-distilled bergamot top note from the original 2015 EdT and mixed it with sweet mandarin to remove any real sense of \"wildness\" the original Sauvage has. You get a smooth sweet citrus kept in check with some cardamom, and that vaguely familiar top moves into the heart of lavender, geranium and sage from the eau de parfum joined by the ambrox moved up from the base to make room; the pepper is all but absent in this version of Sauvage, replaced by a candied amber note. The base is full of \"smooth-over\" notes like vanilla (a hold-over from the EdP), some kind of synthetic sandalwood note, denatured patchouli \"thickness\" without the green feel, and a fat whopping dollop of tonka, which more or less \"foug\u00e8re-ifies\" the accord along with the lavender in the heart. The wear is warm, mild, and pretty uninteresting, taking away everything that made Sauvage what it was in the first place, but giving die-hards more flexibility in winter when fatter base notes are preferred. I'd call this the most romantic form of Sauvage, but it is still very office-friendly, and will last all day although with intense sillage but poor projection.\n\r\nWho wants something like this you say? Well, people who hate the smell of Sauvage but for some odd reason want to own a Dior masculine perfume with the name \"Sauvage\" on the bottle, or fanboys of the line, completionist collectors that must own everything, and maybe people duped by the marketing and/or sales associates trained to pitch the stuff, but nobody else. I liked the bizarre futurism of the original release, and the tidier EdP presentation of 2018 was nice if unnecessary, but this one just feels too surgically altered, too tamped-down, buttoned-up, and homogenized to smell like every other sweet tonka bomb currently on the market with only the faintest traces of Sauvage DNA in the mix to set it apart. Obviously one person's \"perfectly boring\" may be another's \"perfectly satisfying\", so I won't say not to go out and give this a shot, as it may be your favorite rendition of the line even if it isn't mine. My take-away is that Sauvage operates much like Fahrenheit in the higher concentrations; it loses that controversial fire which makes it iconic (or irritating depending on perspective) as the ingredients are blended together closer and \"creamed\" over to increase the bottom-end but milden the heady top. Sauvage Parfum is a close pass for me, but your thoughts may differ from mine so sample accordingly. Neutral. ",

I get a very similar impression here, but it looks like those elements are created in a different way. The sweetness and creamyness must come from dates and tonka beans.

Not unpleasant by any means \u2013 it\u2019s mild, sweet and rosy \u2013 but it\u2019s the kind of thing one expects to be on sale for 20 bucks.\r\nCurious, I returned to the house\u2019s promotional material on this one. Apparently Love Kills asks the question:  \u2018What happens when the freshness of a rose in full bloom fades away?\u2019 Well, yes, they seem to have answered that. But should I care\u2026? \r\nThen after about 90 minutes it seemed to gain strength and fortification resembling \u2018angry\u2019 roses in the Une Rose vein \u2013 the geranium and patchouli now sounding as power chords to the rose\u2019s bleat. While I was pleased with this new-found assertiveness, the overall composition still didn\u2019t seem to be offering something to make it stand out a bit from other deadlifting roses out there. It seems destined to remain in the bulging middle. \n\n",

It\u2019s a fairly agreeably sweet and spicy blend that feels more winter-leaning, as I find most Montale/Mancera fragrances do, though it doesn\u2019t immediately come off as something unique or unfamiliar.\n\r\nThe note listing is a fairly agreeable blend of rose, sandalwood, vetiver, ambergris, leather, and vanilla, but I get a sort of multifaceted saffron-like spiciness from it that mixes with rose and vanilla.  Perhaps it\u2019s the leather/vetiver combo that does that. It\u2019s sweet and spicy but not prohibitively much of either, and the leather and rose remain fairly in the background for those that might have an issue with an abundance of either.  It feels hearty and interesting, not too fleeting or fashionable, perfectly unisex and dense and rich enough for the cooler weather.  There\u2019s just a touch of powder, perhaps maybe via the ambergris, but it\u2019s not sharp to the point of being annoying.   The result feels simple and staple-like.\n\r\nSimple can be great\u2014the recent release Montale Oud Dream only lists notes of rose, patchouli, and oud, and it smells superbly well blended.  Pure Love similarly has a pretty familiar straightforward note list\u2014albeit not quite as short as Oud Dream\u2019s\u2014but is just somewhat less great overall.  Still a very easy one to wear, though, for those that do not want too much of anything, and want to avoid oud in a winter-leaning Montale/Mancera, in particular.   I quite like it but it just doesn\u2019t jump out at me much.\n\r\nPure Love is sold where other Montales are, including great boutiques like Krystal Fragrance, who included my sample (with many others) with a purchase.

Arabians Tonka has a burnt sugar / tonka mix adding a lot of sweetness, only very slightly sharp, with rose and oud and perhaps some woods in the background, too. \n\r\nIt\u2019s very easy to enjoy and I quite like it, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a miss, but considering the number of releases put out by the Montale/Mancera empire each year, it\u2019s unsurprising that some like Arabians Tonka will be a bit redundant with prior releases.

First impression is that of concentrated woods and resins, cedar and patchouli, though no cedar is present, so this must be the oud I am experiencing.  An odd thing here, because I usually loathe oud (would much rather smell ammonia), but this is unlike any oud I have experienced and is very intensely attractive.\n\r\nI\u2019m taken back to my father\u2019s wood working shop, to the scent of a stain being rubbed into freshly sawn wood. Olfactory memory overload at work here. It is interesting to me that Le Dore uses two patchoulis, an older one from the 1940s for his heart note, and a new one for his base note. \n\r\nTen minutes on, the intensity has diminished, and it is fading to a lighter eau concentration. However, there has been no development or deepening in this progression. It remains linear.\n\r\nThe notes of bergamot, peach, carnation and angelica never reach my nose.

I get no oak moss, no leather accord, no musk, no amber, just the oud/patchouli concentration. So, a linear and simple impression, which is certainly pleasant and decidedly masculine. It would have benefited from more complexity in the middle notes, to my way of thinking, but judging it for what it is, not what it might have been, I find it to be an excellent linear impression of \u201cwoods.\u201d\n\r\nCertainly the quality of the materials used is stellar in today\u2019s perfume world.

And the only reason it isn't is because it tends to \"vibrate\" only in the lower portion of the octave scent-register. In this way it reminds me of Anubis by Papillon. The two frags smell nothing alike, but they both seem to consist primarily of base notes with very few top notes to add lift or a bright dissonance and contrast. The peach aldehyde and bergamot here, last mere seconds before drifting away, so what you are left smelling is a rich and oud-y oak moss that is intriguing in a dark and low-toned way. As the scent lingers on, I am most reminded of vintage Mitsouko (minus the everlasting peach) and Cuir de Russie (minus the florals). Since I adore both of these scents, I find Antiquity quite intriguing, but I am also willing to admit that I would love this fragrance even more if it contained a wider octave range--say one that included some notes above middle C.",

As the composition moves to its early heart, the oud settles down, moving to the background, ceding way to an emergent super-strong animalic, leathery musk that becomes the focal point of the composition through the entire mid-section.  During the late dry-down, the musk finally recedes to unveil the powdery amber and oakmoss-driven base but still hangs around, now in support through the finish.

The chocolatey real oud driven open gets things going on the right foot, but the leathery animalic musk and deep rugged patchouli driven heart is way over-the-top for this writer's tolerance level.  One can certainly appreciate the ingredient quality used here that is obviously top-notch, but the composition is just too rough around the edges, lacking the polish to match.  The powdery late dry-down is very ho-hum, with the perfumer choosing to feature the powdery facets of the oakmoss instead its mossy-green quality.  One wonders what the end result would have been if the stellar ingredients used here were composed by a more professionally skilled hand.  As things stand, the discontinued Antiquity has its moments, showing plenty of potential with some crazy good materials only to ultimately disappoint due to lack of polish and control, earning it a \"good\" rating of 3 stars out of 5 and a very hesitant recommendation to most unless you like your compositions \"rough around the edges.\"     ",

This floral animalic combination hangs around through the entire middle section of the composition's development until the rose gradually recedes and eventually disappears as the composition slowly moves to the late dry-down, revealing a base comprised of sharp, piercing woody vetiver that takes the fore joined by the now subdued powdery remnants of the orris root and animalic musk through the finish.  Projection is excellent, and longevity is very good at 10-12 hours on skin.\n\r\nWar and Peace poses quite the quandary to this writer.  On the one hand, the animalic musk and dark rose pairing, when coupled with the dense powder of the orris is *extremely* challenging to wear, dare I say wholly off-putting. Getting to the late dry-down is quite the chore, and quite frankly, I doubt I normally would have made it, scrubbing this sucker off as fast as possible.  That said, I am happy to have endured the onslaught, as the late dry-down reveals an amazing hardcore vetiver, not unlike the stuff found in the Turtle Vetiver series from LesNez. As that vetiver is some of the best unadulterated stuff on the planet, being compared to it is high praise indeed.  That said, I come full circle to the middle section of War and Peace that is just so tough to endure and ultimately I just can't say the great vetiver driven finish is quite worth it.  The bottom line is the already sold out limited edition War and Peace displays some great quality materials, and a finish worthy of them, but the overly challenging price of admission proves too dear, yielding an \"above average\" 2.5 to 3 stars out of 5 rating and a neutral recommendation to all but the most ardent lovers of all things animalic.",

This is especially so when one considers the top-quality oils and the overly generous concentrations used by Le Dore in his compositions.\n\r\nWar And Peace begins with a blast of powdery, suede-like orris, supported by the sweet/bitter combo of ambergris, castoreum and civet. The musk and amber resin provide a safe background for the development, which is remarkably slow. I keep waiting for the rose to appear, but she is quite shy. Who wouldn\u2019t be when faced with this remarkable assembly of base notes? You could cut the testosterone with a knife.\n\r\nLike other Le Dores which I have sampled (Antiquity and Siberian Summer), this seems to be designed solely for the scent lover to wear in private, not for going out in society. I can hardly think of a social instance in which any of these three scents would be appropriate.\n\r\nAh, the patchouli and vetiver emerge and balance the suede/ambergris/castoreum/civet conglomerate. Rose, where are you? Currently, I am in an ancient library with suede covered volumes, opened and lying about in the sunlight, whlle the warmth of the aged paper infiltrates the air. The smoke of burning autumn leaves drifts in through the window. Still no rose.  Well, perhaps this rose renders my nose anosmic.\n\r\nTo sum up, for me this is a smoky, musky, animalic suede, very decently constructed, but leaving one wishing this remarkable base composition had a bouquet of florals and a top of fruit or citrus, to add to the complexity. Le Dore is an expert at creating bases. Now he needs to concentrate on building the rest of the parfum pyramid top layers.\n",

You can smell the deer musk as it announces it's presence but it is kept in check by the rose and powder.\n\r\nAs time goes by the musk becomes more pronounced and then starts to get leathery. This is where the castoreum comes into play. So you have a scent that is rosey, musky and leathery with a slight incense like amber.\n\r\nNow well into the drydown after many hours you can smell a very lovely sweet ambery musky ambergris accord with a animalic tinge.

I expected the Dore to be a combination of overwhelming tropical floral with suede-like orris keeping it from becoming too screechy.\n\r\nThe reality is quite different. This is very subdued.  The orris is center stage with light whiffs of a sweet honeysuckle accord and the dry fruity apricot accord weaving in and out. The orris is not powdery suede, but slightly raw and harsh to my nose. Once this first impression settles in, there is little development, with the plumeria and apricot fading quickly, thus giving the lie to the scent\u2019s name. If I hold my sprayed wrist at arm\u2019s length I can detect the plumeria/apricot/vanilla accord, but up close, I only experience the orris.\n\r\nLike all the Dores I have experienced thus far (this is the fourth), there is little or no projection; all wear close to the skin. \n\r\nThis creation does not impress me and I had so hoped it would.

As the composition moves to its early heart, the orris now comes on strong, taking the sole starring role, with the plumeria continuing to smell somewhat similar to coconut, but adding a gardenia-like facet as the florals sharpen as time passes, adding a touch of additional sweetness from a vanilla and creamy sandalwood tandem that stays far back in additional subtle support. During the late dry-down the orris loses is powdery facet (and its detectable plumeria co-star), finally ceding its focal role to allow touches of woody, lemony vetiver in the base to emerge as co-star, with the sandalwood remaining in support as a slight sweetener through the finish. Projection is average, but longevity is outstanding at well over 12 hours on skin.\n\r\nOK, now we're talking...  While Orris/iris focal compositions tend to be some of my least favorites, Plumeria de Orris can't be denied as a truly fine effort.  The ingredient quality is fabulous, with extremely high quality ingredients used.  While I don't have a lot of prior experience with plumeria (as the ingredient is too expensive for most perfume ingredient budgets), sniffing it here has been quite the education as not only does it smell quite good, its facets seem to shift throughout the development making pinning down any easy way to describe it quite elusive.  My use of words like coconut and gardenia really don't do the plumeria justice, but the truth is in its implementation here it doesn't quite smell like anything I have sniffed to date, making the experience all the more exciting and unique.  The vetiver and sandalwood driven base is skillfully kept in-check to meld perfectly with the remnants of the orris, making for an outstanding late dry-down.  The bottom line is the $200 per 30ml Plumeria de Orris may not be *my* kind of composition due to its orris focus, but it most certainly could and arguably *should* be many others', earning an \"excellent\" 4 stars out of 5 rating and a strong recommendation to all orris/iris composition fans, and/or admirers of rare, unique smelling ingredients.

The Sandalwood seems to ground the scent and give it more body whilst making it more unisex.\n\r\nAs we move into the basenotes you can smell a slight resinous myrhh which does become stronger though this does not diminish the flowery fruity orris glazed in honey accord.\n\r\nAlso now and again you can smell a very slight animalic civet note but it comes and goes very quickly. It adds a slight animalic tinge.\n\r\nNow the longevity is good with this lasting more than ten hours but the projection is about average.\n\r\nI like this though I do feel that the orris dominates everything else and drowns out the Plumeria accord for a lot of the time. When it does show it self it smells very lovely!",

It pounced on me like a cat, this was followed by lime, bergamot and a smoky camphor note. \n\r\nThe musk is nice and slightly sweet which is mixed in with a green pine and I'm picking up on a lot of smoke.\n\r\nIt smells like your walking towards a piney musky smelling forest where there is smoke in the distance coming from within the forest. There is this slight woody aroma underneath the musk that is very nice indeed. It compliments the piney smoky musk.\n\r\nEventually the vetiver comes with this woodyness and it adds a nice contrast to the musky pine scent accord. Though in the basenotes the cedar comes into play and that woodyness makes the scent smell very dry like smelling piney musk in a desert.\n\r\nNow it smells nice for a good while though it is a bit astringent and harsh smelling especially if you try to smell the scent up close. Then it does become a bit one dimensional and I do detect a pissy urine accord that I don't like.\n\r\nThe musk will keep tantalizing your nose though I am not keen on the cedar and when it turns very dry and I mean desert dry. At this stage I cannot help feeling that I have had enough.\n\r\nThe longevity is good with over several hours and more but like a lot from the range the projection is below average.

However, this is a pleasant way to begin this olfactory experience. The musk engages the nose and allows the other notes to slowly introduce themselves.\n\r\nThese green notes balance themselves between astringent (lime, birch, vetiver) and warm (balsam, bergamot, galbanum, oakmoss). The musk is always present to round them out and the cedar lends a dryness, leading you from the heart to the dry down.  The sole floral, jasmine, is to my nose lost in the mix. The camphor is present for only a brief time and seems to work with the musk to create the animalic, civet-like undertone to the scent.\n\r\nQuality of ingredients is exceptional. Projection is minimal. This wears close to the skin. It seems to me to be a masculine scent, but a strong, mature, and/or forceful female personality could pull it off. To be worn at play, not for romance or the office.\n\r\nQuite unusual and a good alternative to those Christmas Tree balsam scents that begin well and end in cookie dough madness. This is for those who love the scent of pine and fir trees and seems ideal for wearing during the Christmas holiday season.\n",

			"content": "Siberian Summer opens with a coniferous green fir balsam, adding just a hint of smoky camphor and birch tar support.  As the composition moves to its early heart, the green coniferous fir remains, soon morphing into more of a relatively sharp green pine rising from the base, coupling with relatively benign musk.  During the late dry-down, the green pine and musk tandem recedes but remains, now pairing with slightly powdery vanilla and barely sweet amber through the finish.  Projection is average, and longevity very good at around 10 hours on skin.\n\r\nThe coniferous green open of Siberian Summer smells heavenly.  It captures the smell of a coniferous green forest quite well without ever going overboard.  When the composition adds the pine accord from the base it only reinforces the composition's biggest strength.  The musk that is used to pair with the coniferous notes is likely synthetic (unlike the stuff used in many of the other Areej le Dore compositions), but while to many this may come as sacrilege, I find the synthetic stuff here much easier to digest and wear.  Yes, it lacks the depth of the real stuff, but in this case it just feels \"right\" and never overpowers the other ingredients like the real stuff does in other compositions from the house.  The only negative to this otherwise fine effort is in the late dry-down, where the composition turns to a very generic vanilla and amber driven powdery finish that is completely forgettable.  The bottom line is the $160 per 30ml bottle Siberian Summer starts off outstanding but ends in a bit of a whimper, earning a 3.5 to 4 star out of 5 \"very good\" to \"excellent\" rating and a solid recommendation to all, especially coniferous composition lovers.  It may end relatively mundane, but the journey in this case is worth it.    ",

			"content": "Roja Dove has decided to replace several masculine lines of the axed eau de parfum concentration with \"parfum cologne\" variants that are entire reworkings of their respective compositions, to be fresher, more vibrant, and with greater projection like an eau de toilette. These \"parfum colognes\" are still technically eau de parfum in concentration, but really come across like eau de toilette concentr\u00e9e with packaging inspired by Elysium pour Homme Cologne (2017), which joins the \"parfum cologne\" range retroactively. Danger pour Homme Cologne (2019) fits nicely into this range, fixing some of what many didn't like about the original Danger pour Homme (2011), but at the same time moving even closer to being a direct homage to the 80's style it copies. Those skeptic of the brand's intentions will still sneer at the $300MSRP of this new concentration range, and for scents like Danger that seek to emulate vintage styles so closely, there are still better buys out there. In light of all that, this is nice for what it seeks to be, and far nicer in my opinion than the higher concentrations in which it can be found. In my opinion this is the best of the \"parfum cologne\" range, and even better than Elysium pour Homme Cologne, which technically started the whole thing.\n\r\nDanger pour Homme Cologne comes across with a lot of citrus and petitgrain accompanied by lavender, feeling even more like Guerlain H\u00e9ritage (1992) to which it is often compared, but with stronger lemon notes that bring it closer to something like Versace L'Homme (1984) or Chanel Pour Monsieur Eau de Toilette Concentr\u00e9e (1989). For vintage lovers, this can only be a good thing, but for those who appreciated what modern touches the original Danger pour Homme had, this moves the composition further than before into \"dad's cologne\" territory. Jasmine and muguet bring up the traditional heart of Danger, with a bit of tarragon peaking in, but the mega-opaque Roja Dove base is still what this scent is all about. There are too many notes to list here, but all the plush spice, woods, and musk you could want lives here within IFRA limitations (of course), blended immaculately. I actually much prefer this to the original release, even with shorter wear time, as it just blooms far brighter and smells more classic than it did before. Wear time clocks in at about eight hours, and projection is good while it lasts, with the scent quieting down to be a closer eau de parfum experience about halfway into that, but due to the citrus and jasmine hedione, Danger pour Homme Cologne now becomes a serious warm weather contender whereas the original version might stifle in hot surroundings.\n\r\nI think the concept behind something closer to \"entry level\" for the brand was bound to happen, as dictated by how well Elysium pour Homme Cologne has sold. This isn't really Roja Dove \"selling out\" (although some elitist fanboys might be apt to say that), because you just can't survive for long on one-percenters alone if you want to be more than a novelty act in the perfume market at large. There seems to be no slowing down on exclusives and semi-bespoke creations only sold at his Harrod's boutique, so for those Roja Dove followers who buy heavily into the exclusivity of the brand, the existence of the \"parfum cologne\" range doesn't look like it will run the risk of making Roja Parfums feel more \"common\", and you're still not going to see this stuff in most high-end department stores outside the UK, so relax. I'm still unsure of the value here, but I do really truly like the classic masculine semi-oriental foug\u00e8re lines on display with Danger pour Homme Cologne, especially being tweaked to feel even more authentic and true-to-source, although no less derivative of past works than before. Let your nose decide if this is worth reconsidering by getting your hands on a sample, but for my part this is worth getting if you enjoy this genre and have the cash to not care. Thumbs up.",

			"content": "Enigma/Creation-E pour Homme Cologne (2019) is a new alternate eau de parfum version that replaced the outgoing original Enigma/Creation-E pour Homme (2013) formula, which itself was retained in style but bumped up to extrait de parfum concentration (with a very hefty price bump per ml to match). I was never a fan of the original cola/cough syrup over boozy toasted almond and tobacco that was the original version, and this lighter, brighter, more dynamic version doesn't really improve on that. The whole \"parfum cologne\" range represents something closer to an eau de toilette concentr\u00e9e take on some of Roja Parfum's more popular masculines, being the new entry level for the exorbitantly high-end brand, although at $300MSRP, these are still far from anything most fragrance hobbyists would consider starter even within the realms of niche perfume. Still, you can get your foot in the door with a Roja Dove perfume retooled for projection and greater transparency like the suprise Elysium pour Homme Cologne (2017) which started it all, so that can only be a good thing.\n\r\nEnigma/Creation-E pour Homme Cologne starts off much like the original eau de parfum, but with an even-more pronounced cola-type aromachemical opening that really hearkens back to stuff like Yves Saint Laurent M7 (2002); now I wasn't a huge fan of that either, but for people who like it, this might appeal. From there, we get a heliotrope-dominated heart with rose, jasmine, and geranium acting like backup singers, and it's a little too sweet for me already, but does tamp down some in the base. Like all Roja Dove creations, the base has way too many notes to even begin picking them all out, since he tries to copy the Jacques Guerlain blended style, but the opacity is lessened here from what it was in the original Enigma/Creation-E pour Homme. I get a lot of benzoin flavored with ginger and cardamom, over some ambroxan and tonka for that boozy amaretto and tobacco kind of feeling, touched by pepper and patchouli, but that's it. The \"parfum cologne\" variant of Enigma/Creation-E pour Homme really closes in on gourmand territory, so fans of A*Men by Thierry Mugler (1996) take note. Wear time is eight hours and projection is respectable until the latter half of the scent, where it becomes a proper EdP in sillage. \n\r\nAt the end of the day, I don't hate this, but it is the worst of the range in my opinion and not worth the money. You may feel differently if you loved the original and that's okay, but this feels more like a flanker to it than a retooling at a lower concentration as the name suggests, which itself is derivative of what Chanel and Dior have done with their masculines. Enigma/Creation-E pour Homme Cologne is probably the most modern member of the range next to ELysium pour Homme Cologne, and certainly the most unique, but modern and unique in and of themselves don't sell fragrances to me, especially if what's presented isn't something I find enjoyable. Under threat of sounding like some old vintage perfume curmudgeon, I really do think Roja Dove excells more at and therefore should stick to revisiting the past than trying to push into the future, with this being more proof of that in my eyes. Sample and see for yourself, especially if this kind of thing really is your cup of tea. I can take it or leave it myself. Neutral.",

			"content": "I don\u2019t know about the Parfum because I never tried it, but I\u2019ve really been enjoying Creation-E Parfum Cologne. To begin with, it\u2019s plenty potent: I get very good projection for the first 3 or 4 hours before it gets closer to skin but then it still holds on for another three or four, not so much projecting but still with a solid presence that continues to waft off and is easily detectable up close. So overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s longevity is about 8 to 10!hours. Equally important, it smells great\u2014complex, interesting, but also pleasant and alluring. The opening threw me off a little the first couple of times around, as it\u2019s surprisingly bitter, comprised of floral notes that have this bitter/soapy smell paired with the spices (mainly ginger and nutmeg). But the bitterness works well here (much more so than in another fragrance I recently experienced, Parfums de Marly\u2019s Kalan), as it gives the fragrance a very clean, traditional impression in the manner of oakmoss (even though it\u2019s not actually oakmoss) which establishes some contrast next to the spices. It also doesn\u2019t over-stay it\u2019s welcome. Very gradually and smoothly, the bitter-clean aspect recedes and disappears as a slightly resinous vanilla-benzoin note takes shape, giving Enigma it\u2019s \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d impression when working together with the ginger. At Enigma\u2019s core, there\u2019s a solid tobacco note, kind of a middle of the road, aromatic variety which establishes a firm backbone without really ever dominating the scent itself. The tobacco is certainly there, and it\u2019s important to the whole, but its role is more in the way of a note you\u2019d notice a lot if it was suddenly taken out of the composition than the kind of note you immediately notice and focus on when it\u2019s there. What really drives Enigma are the floral notes from the opening, the ginger and nutmeg spices, and the benzoin and vanilla. In the end, these create a smell which is not only complex and somewhat entertaining to watch unfold, but also one that smells great\u2014it\u2019s both fresh and spicy, but also sweet and resinous, with the sweetness kept in check and balanced by some bitter notes, and its entirety working to drive that cola accord which is utterly addictive and fun to smell. \n\r\nThis has been one of my favorite discoveries of 2019 (along with Overture). It\u2019s a complex, pleasant scent that\u2019s easy to wear and pretty versatile in terms of weather and occasion. It\u2019s original as well\u2014other than its predecessor, I doubt there\u2019s much out there that smells like Creation-E. At least I haven\u2019t smelled anything like it. I was skeptical of the new Parfum Colognes, having owned and not been very impressed by Elysium Parfum Cologne, but this gives me hope for the others, in terms of performance and complexity/depth. I should note that I do not get a lot of cognac in this, only hints, which is fine with me. Final rating, an excellent 9.5/10.\n\r\nFinal note: One thing I\u2019d like to point out, and why I gave this one such a high, 9.5 rating, is the fact that I don\u2019t like really thick, heavy scents. I prefer scents with some buoyancy, and some degree of a fresh, airy, uplifted quality over those that wear like thick, heavy blankets. Enigma Parfum Cologne has this buoyant kind of quality, just the right amount of it without losing too much, keeping enough complexity and depth and roundness in tact while remaining somewhat light and easy to wear.",

			"content": "Now this is quite a turnaround! The original Scandal pour Homme (2011) smelled like a two-bit con-job trying to pass as a high-end take on Guerlain H\u00e9ritage (1992), but now smells almost entirely like a different animal, while Danger pour Homme (2011) used to be the more-modern of the pair. Scandal pour Homme Cologne (2019) as part of the expanded \"parfum cologne\" range smells sweeter, more modern, and versatile, while Danger pour Homme Cologne (2019) ironically moves closer to being a reference of Guerlain H\u00e9ritage but still smells unique enough to not be called a clone. My review for that scent lies elsewhere, but I must say I am very pleasantly  surprised by Scandal pour Homme Cologne, considering I flunked out the original for the sham that it is. What we get here is a rounder, fresher, verbena-led barbershop foug\u00e8re that has some commonality with verbena-led chypres like Geoffrey Beene Bowling Green (1986), or Dunhill Edition (1984), but with more of that lemon drop feeling of the former. If you like summery, sweet, but still warm, rich, and masculine where it counts, this might be the best of the Roja Dove \"parfum cologne\" range. For me, Danger pour Homme Cologne still gets the crown while Elysium pour Homme Cologne (2017) remains the best modern option in the range (and the one that started it), but this could easily see use alongside them to me. \n\r\nScandal pour Homme Cologne has a happy opening of lemon oil, spearmint, verbena, lavender, and bergamot that moves into an amiable middle. Rose and jasmine make an appearance here as they do in many Roja Dove creations, with a nice hedione note surrounded by other florals like muguet and violet. A bit of tarragon and petitgrain creep in around this time too, but the real personality of course comes in with that brick wall of a base that Roja Dove favors. Once again, there is too much going on here (a Roja Dove trademark by this point), but I get an interesting cumin and sandalwood note very similar to Brooks Brothers New York for Gentleman (2008), which was something Danger pour Homme in its original form had but now finds home here in Scandal pour Homme Cologne. Outside of that, it's all plush musks, tonka, oakmoss, patchouli, and more, with everything melting into a big blob of warmth on skin. Projection is better than before, but longevity is only a mere \"mortal\" eight hours. I'd say this is best used in all seasons but winter, and feels more casual than some other entries in the line because of the sweetness inherent throughout, although Scandal pour Homme Cologne is anything but a clubber even in light of that lemon drop opening. There is also nothing really scandalous about Scandal pour Homme Cologne besides the price, which is obviously too much even at the new \"entry point\" of $300MSRP for the brand.\n\r\nFans who love Roja Dove because splurging on his creations makes their sociopathic hoarding of wealth seem justified have nothing to fear from a new lower-priced line, as it is still unlikely to make a dent into the Nordstroms or Saks Fifth Avenues of the world, and will still be the pervue of niche boutiques tucked away into haute bourgeois shopping districts of the Western world's wealthiest cities. Futhermore, good old Roger is still cranking out semi-bespoke creations and exclusives only sold at his home base or what few remote counters he has, so these \"parfum colognes\" are aimed more at the YouTube-watching Parfums de Marly, Maison Francis Kurkdijan, or Amouage fan than the world at large. Whether or not you think the hype is real should be determined by your nose anyway, but I rather enjoy Scandal pour Homme Cologne, even if I'm not wholly on board with the brand image of the house itself. Scandal pour Homme Cologne has come a long way from being an overpriced vintage clone in the original formula to something unique, enjoyable, and able to stand on its own in this new \"parfum cologne\" reorchestration, and I'm left thoroughly impressed by both the efforts and results of the transformation. This isn't my favorite from the line by far, but easily goes toe-to-toe with some of the brighter warm weather options released by the aforementioned Amouage, stopping short of being a true freshie of course.

			"content": "Roja Parfums Vetiver pour Homme Cologne (2019) is the only entry of the expanded \"parfum cologne\" range that took me by surprise with its inclusion, as I had not figured Roja Dove Vetiver pour Homme (2012) as being all that popular in light of other fragrances that get more talk. However, like all the other \"parfum cologne\" re-orchestrations, this replaces the discontinued eau de parfum versions (the formulas of which have been condensed into pricier extrait format) to become the new baseline versions of these scents. In all cases, the sliders have been moved towards projection, dynamism, and transparency of top and heart notes, which can only be a good thing for a vetiver perfume. Fans of the original Vetiver pour Homme liked the combination of old-school and new-school vetiver treatment on display, but detractors weren't keen on the smooth blended feel and density of the original eau de parfum. Here in \"parfum cologne\" form, all that has been fixed.\n\r\nRoja Dove Vetiver pour Homme Cologne very much still opens with the litsea cubeba/may chang (mountain pepper) note that distinguised both the pour Homme and unisex extrait treatments of vetiver previously, so you have to enjoy that to like this version too. Lemon and bergamot join in the top, but the personality of this \"parfum cologne\" lives in the heart, where the addition of cumin alongside jasmine hedione sit over the rose and labdanum, not the other way around as before. The vetiver is sandwiched in the smorgasbord of notes that Roja Dove calls a base but it's there. The tobacco, galbanum, and oakmoss recall the more classsic style of vetiver a la Guerlain or Carven, with leafiness and nuttiness present, while the fresher Tom Ford style marries to it with cedar, Iso E Super, and pink pepper. Wear time is \"only\" eight hours but projection is actually higher than the original eau de parfum format, with Vetiver pour Homme Cologne being the most office-safe in the range next to Elysium pour Homme Cologne (2017), which started this madness.\n\r\nSadly, although among one of the most pleasant and versatile of the \"parfum cologne\" range, Vetiver pour Homme Cologne is also the hardest sell at $300MSRP because there are so many quality options for vetiver-focused masculines more easily-had that you really just have to be in love with the brand to choose this over them. One could buy both Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (2007) in eau de parfum and Guerlain Vetiver (1961) at full retail price and attempt to layer them for a decent approximation and spend less, although you don't get the seamless plush blending that Roja Dove enjoys without springing for his take on the subject. Vetiver pour Homme Cologne also seems the most timeless of the entire line, as everything else is either banking on trend (Elysium, Creation-E), or rose-tinted glasses for older near-extinct styles (Danger, Scandal), while Vetiver pour Homme Cologne exists on its own terms as a contemporary take on a perrenial subject. Is it worth the asking price? You be the judge, but as a perfume worth owning, there's so much choice in this style that I feel indifferent about it. Neutral",

This is a warm fuzzy feeling that pervades this attractive holiday fougere mostly from the benzoin and cinnamon.  Also prominent is rosy warmth of rhubarb and pimento which contrasts nicely with the icy coldness of wintery opening from eucalyptus, patchouli, wintergreen and thyme. I have seen this scent described as a patchouli fragrance but I get more powdery warmth and a cooling from eucalyptus and patchouli which fades after the first hour.  The only significance I can derive from the provocative title, Female Christ,  is the softness and feminine powdery character coupled with the smell of a snow covered winter forest scene.  Thinking of the holidays and a white Christmas when smelling this scent.  Female Christ would be nice Christmas gift for somebody special.",

In the press releases for this scent she said she worked on it with the perfumer for over 4 years. The manufacturer (Scent Beauty) is marketing it as a 'unisex' fragrance. It's not. It's an eye-watering, nostril-singeing, super feminine floral. Just taking the cap off unleashes a blast of synthetic flowers. Top notes are listed on the Scent Beauty website as 'Bergamot, Clove, Neroli' - I couldn't detect any bergamot or clove at all. The base notes were alleged to include vetiver, sandalwood, and vanilla. Didn't detect a hint of any of those notes either. All I could smell was the jasmine, rose, orangeflower, and neroli notes and those are all amped by a huge dose of aldehydes. This is bordering on the Poison/Giorgio Beverly Hills level of 'assault weapon' fragrances. If you picked up a random bottle at Bath and Body Works and it smelled like this you wouldn't be surprised. But coming from a niche perfumery house at the selling price it's a bit of a shock.  Super-cool bottle, though. ",

			"content": "Salute is apparently named after the salutation Italian people say when drinking wine together.  It's wine-influenced but does it without resorting to the rose/patch/oak combination perfumes usually use to evoke wine smells.  \n\r\nInstead, Salute is a combination of blackberry and iris with rubbery musks and a hard-to-describe yeasty dough smell.  It's a weird combination (and, for the record, not the pleasant yeasty dough iris smell from Mitsouko).  The first couple of times I wore Salute, the combination of sweet blackberry and weirdness felt to me like a fruity floral gone horrendously awry, but it has slowly won me over.\n\r\nSo what does it really smell like?  Well, the blackberry and rubbery musk call to mind L'Artisan's Mure Et Musk Extreme, but it's much more focused on the plasticky element of the musk and the way that plastic mixes with iris to smell doughy and odd.  To its credit, it did remind me of wine even before I read the description - it's not wine directly, but the weird yeasty fermenting smell of a wine cave.  Alternately, it reminds me of the yeasty smell of a good French champagne, but minus the actual champagne smell.  Or maybe what you'd get if you saved the milk from your bowl of Froot Loops cereal, let it sit out for a few days until it turned, and then mixed it with the smell of paint drying.\n\r\nIf my descriptions are making Salute smell kind of unappealing, it is.  But it's just so different and artful that it's won me over as an intellectual concept.  This may also be fun to sample for iris fanatics looking for something truly different.  ",

At first there was a wave of sweetness and I thought ok, it's very sweet but nothing bad or challenging; that lasted the first 5 seconds until I started to get a salty fishy note. Diving in more with my nose into the skin, I'm not sure if I get a plastic or a metallic note, or maybe both. Now I think that the fishy smell might just be metallic and some plastic rose appeared; it's all very confusing, very sweet and very synthetic smelling and nuclear. I have a desire to go wash it off (which happens very rarely) but I'd like to see what happens next, because it's the first and last time I'll wear it. After the first hour, the metallic note is so pungent that it makes my nose hurt and I can almost feel the overly sweet metallic taste in my through. At this point I think I'm getting a headache and nausea\u2026which almost never happens because a perfume. And I'm off to wash my hand. Of course the smell is there, but at least most of the metallic is gone and it's a sweet cloud of fuzzy rose, still very bad.\r\nIf this is art, I'm ok with me not being able to appreciate it. I think it's just a synthetic mess which smells bad. I can appreciate a good well done perfume even if it's not my taste, but this one\u2026horror. Maybe this is the smell of zombies from The Walking Dead. I usually don't like mainstream generic perfume, but in this case I'd rather smell some Bleu de Chanel right now to calm myself.",

			"content": "There is an apparent laundry list of impressive ingredients to Vetiver Nocturne Autumn '19, but honestly most of the notes are either too well-blended to standout, or used in such small amounts as to be near-undetectable to this writer.  As such, I will skip the usual more objective note and development section of the review and instead just get to what *is* smelled and my opinion of it.  Projection is average, as is longevity at 8-10 hours on skin.\n\r\nWhen first applied on skin, the vetiver immediately comes to the fore with a sharp, piercing concrete-like green/woody quality that is super-hardcore and will scare away all but the most ardent vetiver lovers (as this writer confesses to without shame).  What comes next was wholly unexpected (as I sampled the composition blind without looking at the note pyramid and never sampled the original release), as some real Oud, perhaps Thailand based, emerges in support of the hardcore vetiver.  The combination is something one doesn't smell often, or in my case, ever. It quite frankly doesn't work, at least not here.  The Oud used does not come off as barnyard, but has an off-putting animalic element that just doesn't quite meld properly with the piercingly sharp vetiver.  At this point the composition would have been viewed as a failure, but luckily the late dry-down partially salvages the overall result. This is accomplished as the Oud vacates, leaving the sharp vetiver to now pair with softening dry real sandalwood through the finish, proving a far superior combination that is rather pleasant smelling.  The bottom line is the $330 per 50ml Vetiver Nocturne Autumn '19 gets points for innovation, quality ingredients and daring, but just doesn't smell particularly good earning it an \"average\" 2.5 stars out of 5 rating and an avoid recommendation to all but those who *really* want to smell an odd Oud and vetiver pairing for themselves.

Luckily, while I can tell that it's present in the pollen accord here, it's not that noticeable and the accord is very pleasant to me.\n\r\nAfter a little while the pollen calms down, and the scent starts to get heavier and more resinous (with beeswax), and sweeter (with honey). The honey is also super realistic, as well. Not just a sticky sugar syrup, but reminiscent of the fancy stuff where you get a hint of the flowers that were pollinated as well. I don't get too much of the ginger and orange, maybe a bit on my chest, but I don't mind terribly, the rest of the scent is good enough on it's own.\n\r\nThe projection isn't nearly as strong as some other scents in the house, but it's also an extrait so I guess you can expect it to sit a bit closer to the skin.

As the composition moves to its early heart, fine floral jasmine and slightly sweet benzoin join a significant thickening, smooth, suede-like leathery castoreum and labdanum tandem with hints of the earlier dulled mandarin orange now remaining in support. During the late dry-down, woody vetiver enters the mix, with the composition also adding slightly powdery vanilla to remnants of the suede-like castoreum and mildly sweet benzoin through the finish.  Projection is average, but longevity is outstanding at over 20 hours on skin.\n\r\nGold is a composition created by a perfumer I have had gobs of problems with in the past to put it mildly.  It goes without saying that when I heard Antoine Lie was behind the composition that I was highly confident I would dislike it, even scared to *try* it... I am still somewhat in shock as I write this, but can safely say that Gold is the best thing I have sniffed from Lie, and certainly different from his usual style. In truth, while the perfume may be a tad polarizing, the superb mix of the floral jasmine with the suede-like accord paired with the woody vetiver and slightly sweet elements all play perfectly against one another and the result impresses more and more over time.  After multiple wearings I now can say I love the perfume and have bought a bottle. The bottom line is the $190 per 17.5ml bottle Gold is quite a positive surprise from perfumer Antoine Lie, earning an \"Excellent\" to \"Outstanding\" 4 to 4.5 stars rating out of 5 and a strong recommendation (even to people like me who usually don't care for Mr. Lie's past work).",

It\u2019s fresh, sweet, chalky, highly interesting, and yet is reasonably agreeable, like other recent releases Saint Julep and Sundrunk, in that it\u2019s accessible and fresh for fans for warm-weather-friendly fragrances only, but contains a lot of depth and nuance, like the aforementioned releases.\n\r\nThe listed notes are talc, lavender, black pepper, teak, amyris,  vanilla powder, and fresh linens, with presumably the last of these being the \u201cimaginary\u201d note, an attribute common to each and every perfume of the house.\n\r\nThe black pepper, talc, and teak provide a viable contrast to the robust lavender\u2014Telegrama\u2019s standout note, in my opinion\u2014and the vanilla powder, which acts as a sweet-yet-powdery anchor to the fragrance as it dries down.  It\u2019s linen-fresh yet sweet, slightly powdery (but not screechy or sharp), and just a bit woody, spicy, and chalky to provide some great texture and structure underneath.  \n\r\nIt performs well, too\u2014perhaps not a beast like Cape Heartache, Memoirs of a Trespasser, or A City on Fire, but just a notch down, which feels right, given the versatile type of fragrance it is.  And its bottle design is as nice as ever, with a two-color theme to the usual one-color display, very much on the nose while somehow being a bit different from prior bottles\u2019 designs.\n\r\nLike everything that Josh Meyer releases, Telegrama is innovative and intriguing.  I don\u2019t own every perfume in the IA lineup, but I find it difficult not to admire the artistry in even the fragrances of which I\u2019ve not purchased a bottle, and in that respect, I\u2019d always encourage newcomers to the brand to try the full line and see what clicks with your personal style.  \n\r\nTelegrama is instant \u201clove\u201d for me, providing something new but also with lovable familiar characters (lavender and especially vanilla) but in a different story, the result being a perfume that\u2019s both unique and versatile, as it feels perfectly suited for all seasons and situations.  It\u2019s among my very favorite releases from the house, just a touch below my favorite, Cape Heartache.\n\r\nTelegrama is available on the IA website and great boutiques like Perfumology for what remains a fantastic price of $95 for 50ml, with the 14ml travel size available for $38.  I deem it not only full bottle worthy but backup bottle worthy as well. \n\r\n9 out of 10\n",

I\u2019m fairly picky about floral-dominant fragrances but Zdravetz is balanced enough that I can see it working in lots of situations.  Still, I\u2019m not sure it suits me personally enough that I\u2019d need a full bottle, maybe just a decant to wear randomly.\n\r\nThe pricing of Zdravetz is the same as most of the house\u2019s lineup, $125 for 30ml, and it\u2019s sold at great boutiques, like Twisted Lily and Luckyscent, that carry the brand. \n\r\nAgain, I\u2019d champion pursuing one of the custom sample palettes from the Bruno Fazzolari / Fzotic website as a way of acquiring 3 samples at once, well secured and displayed, with descriptive notecards.  Really great sample presentation.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

Like Ummagumma, it has the rich sweet complexity of a Slumberhouse fragrance.  I saw someone make a comparison to Slumberhouse Baque, specifically, and that is a sound analogy for the mix of liquor and stewed fruits that is common to both fragrances, though I prefer Corpse Reviver\u2019s overall character, which, at least on my skin, is a bit more interesting (with the chocolate, especially), than Baque, one of the few Slumberhouse offerings I\u2019ve bought and re-sold.\n\r\nThe performance is strong, what I\u2019ve typically come to expect of Bruno\u2019s work and choice in ingredients, compositions.\n\r\nAvailable through the Fzotic website and through boutique sites like Luckyscent and Twisted Lily, Corpse Reviver is priced at $145 for 50ml, slightly higher than most of the line, but in line with the previous Luckyscent exclusive, Fontevraud.\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a fragrance I would wear often so I\u2019ll have to give it some more time but I quite like Corpse Reviver.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

			"content": "Mile High is a mildly sweet fruity gourmand wash over the senses with taste of yummy pineapple-upside-down cake accord - only as a fragrance.  I also will compare this to the refreshing flavor of a frosted pi\u00f1a colada cocktail, minus the rum.   Immortelle adds a malted sweetness picked up by pineapple blended with a dry tonka and patchouli base which has an edible evenly spaced experience of the four major aromas. Mile High hangs together like a repeating beat that forms a continuous tone from - immortelle, pineapple, tonka and patchouli - not much change from top to bottom.  There is dissonance and separation between the warm immortelle - tart pineapple - powdery tonka - tight patchouli, that creates a suspended in air, or floating quality to the tart cool sweetness.    Reminds me of a repeating pattern of ambient house music, doesn't change much but is still interesting and on the light bouncy side like the house classic \"Lebanese Blonde by Thievery Corporation\" or \"Little Fluffy Clouds by The Orb\" - nice to listen to and sets a repeating tone and lyrics that becomes all background content.  Definitely this is more a spring / summer scent. Very pleasant but maybe a little too soft and innocent?",

			"content": "GUERLAIN \u2013 DOUBLE EXTRAIT DE FLEURS D\u2019ORANGER\n\r\nThe oils of rose and orange graced many a nineteenth century parfum, lotion, soap and toilet water. Most prevalent and affordable were the so-called \u201cwaters,\u201d oils in alcohol to be added by drops to basins of water, which Madame or Monsieur could use to splash or sponge face, arms and neck to cleanse and scent. Although both sexes used these, men could safely adhere to the orange and feel totally crisp and fresh in the workplace with no accusation of heaviness or femininity, as might occur with the rose.\n\r\nGuerlain\u2019s Double Extrait de Fleurs d\u2019Oranger is certainly a powerhouse of orange in all its forms, flower, leaf, twig and fruit peel. These are beautifully balanced, taking their turns emanating from the bottle or your skin. That marvelously dry accent of Petitgrain, extracted from the leaves and twigs of the bitter orange tree, add the proper counter point to the richness of the orange flower and peel.\n\r\nThese are supported by almond, coumarin, benzoin, sandalwood, musk and vanilla, but sparingly, these bringing a roundness and powdery effect to the orange mixture.\n\r\nNot being satisfied with the creation itself, Guerlain doubled the amount of oils used. Recall that hygiene in 1902 was not what it is today, the world bathing rarely but using sponges soaked in scented water to remove unpleasant body oils and odors, so this doubling of oils was perhaps more practical than showy.\n\r\nAll in all a splendid evocation of orange in all of its aspects. Rarer than hen\u2019s teeth, decants are still available from internet sellers. If you love the scent of orange, do seek it out.\n",

			"content": "So Gucci thinks it's a novelty act to bring back a classic masculine accord, and so assigns such an accord to a limited edition flanker to the original Gucci Guilty pour Homme (2011), as interpreted by modern cost-minimized aromachemical perfumery in an era of maximizing short-term profits over long-term brand integrity. Begrudgingly this works, and I don't like to admit that, because here we have a house that has repeatedly flushed its own legacy down the toilet with every new exchange of hands. It's becoming something of an abusive relationship with Gucci to allow oneself to fall in love with anything they make, knowing it will sooner rather than later be taken away and replaced with something potentially even more banal and catch-all than the last thing, but I like Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme (2019) in spite of that. To be fair, this isn't quite a faithful aromatic foug\u00e8re recreation because it has a few choice embellishments on top to fit the \"love\" aesthetic, ergo some touches that the modern mainstream perfume buyer would perceive as romantic, and doesn't attempt a synthetic oakmoss accord like Montblanc Legend (2011) by using evernyl. I both love and hate talking about these \"new foug\u00e8re\" fragrances in a post-oakmoss world, because I feel like I'm speaking to a schism in the fragrance community between those who have almost a drug-addled fixation on oakmoss, and those who came into enjoying fragrances too late after all the restrictions to really understand why this is such a big deal to some people. In my opinion, this is one of the best in the Gucci Guilty pour Homme line since the the original and Gucci Guilty Absolute pour Homme (2017), but it takes coming to terms with what to expect from this market segment to appreciate it, and there are still far better options that don't come with the caveat of being pre-planned unicorns on the merit of having a limited finite production run at launch. Is Gucci poorly attempting to cash in on their own aftermarket status with fragrances like Gucci Nobile (1988) here? Who knows?\n\r\nThe top of Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme has the odd choice of kumquat, or whatever captive stands in for it, with some mandarin and ginger to build out a fruity semi-sweet spicy \"romantic\" opening. I think classic foug\u00e8re lovers will find the most difficulty in loving this \"love edition\" with the top than with the rest of the fragrance, but if they can set aside their dismissals for just a few minutes, the rest of the fragrance shimmers into place. Lavender, geranium, and rosemary establish the classic aromatic foug\u00e8re heart of Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme, and it mingles with a bit of the fruity accord in the top and the flanking pink pepper in the middle almost like how the neroli and black pepper play with the foug\u00e8re heart of Tsar by Van Cleef & Arpels (1989), making something of an old-school \"sporty\" vibe by accident. Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme leaves memory lane quickly by veering off the nearest exit ramp into a modern ambrox base, but it's honestly not bad even then. Patchouli, vetiver, and benzoin are all classic resins and aromatics found in foug\u00e8res of the past, so here they work to mask the weird transparent warmth ambrox usually gives to a modern fragrance with a bit more bushy depth. At the end of the day, we get a marriage of 1980's and early 90's foug\u00e8re aesthetics with the modern ingenuity perfumers often develop when saddled with briefs from mainstream houses that won't spend the coin on naturals like low-atranol oakmoss or allow more than a few months gestation in the lab before it hits shelves to meet a seasonal deadline. In short, Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme won't please die-hard vintage lovers but will make a small splash outside of that for its retro-green feel with modern versatility (accompanied by the odd bottle color). Wear time for Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme is pretty average for the segment and performance is also pretty much the same. Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme has moderate to high projection at first, with some quieting down later, but the aromatics throughout lend some of their powerhouse charm to the modern ambrox glow so it doesn't smell like your typical \"Sauventus\" one-trick pony on skin.\n\r\nWith so many options for reformulated classic aromatic foug\u00e8res available, Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme may inadvertently prove to be a gateway down the \"vintage cologne guy\" rabbit hole for some younger people after they get their first taste of a proper lavender/geranium tandem, and wonder what they've been missing all this time. The bulk of mainstream buyers will probably just be stuck on kumquat, patchouli, and benzoin portions of the overall accord in Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme, as together they do create a pretty sexy sweet \"jungle fruit\" brusqueness that was last seen in action somewhere around the turn of the millennium. I still think this new limited flanker is pretty office-safe despite the romantic lean because of the old-school aromatics in the composition bringing a bit of the brisk \"sportiness\" guys who lived through the 80's will remember with early Lacoste efforts, but this same group will also probably be too hung up on the modern facets and lack of oakmoss to notice that connection. I can sort of see why this would be a limited edition, because the combination of Gordon Gecko and Elon Musk on display in Gucci Guilty Love Edition pour Homme is too dated for the average GQ-reading Chad, but too modern for the oatmilk latte-swilling hipster that records his Spotify lists to cassette so he can play them in his 87 Honda Prelude's OEM stereo. Vintage guys will sniff the top notes and go \"hate it\" while everyone else will be puzzled by the Gucci with the same color green on its bottle as a 1960's refrigerator, but I guess the right hype from a big enough YouTuber could put enough spin on this to catch some heat. Otherwise, this one is going to sell on impulse alone until it ends up in discounters, like most Gucci Guilty pour Homme flankers. Test it out and see for yourself while you still can, as I expect this is meant to run through Valentine's Day 2020. If you're reading this review way after the fact, you might as well just go to eBay, as it will have joined the rest of the discontinued Guccis there. Thumbs up.",

Skeptics might even be tempted to call it a marketing ploy to play up the desirable \u2018exotic factor\u2019.

			"content": "Eau Capitale by Diptyque (2019) is a stunning modern interpretation of the 80's animalic rose chypre, and sits somewhere between a classic example of one like Montana Parfum de Peau (1986) and the bigger-boned animalic rose patchouli chypres like Est\u00e9e Lauder Knowing (1988) that also existed at the time. Of course, being as this is a completely 21st century perfume beholden not just to IFRA restrictions but also sensibilities of the market base, Eau Capitale is going to be extremely light on any animalic tones and contain only a speck of oakmoss (if any) in the structure. Ultimately, this proves fine to my nose, as I appreciate a subtle tease sometimes more than gratuity anyway, but to the hard-nosed vintage purist, this will probably prove insufficient. For everyone else, Eau Capitale is a bold rose chypre that is very faithful by design, but colors within the lines of what squeaks by the censure of the buying public or perfume industry itself, which isn't easy.\n\r\nEau Capitale opens with a lusciously jammy Turkish rose and bergamot, very similar to Ungaro Diva (1983). Perfumer Olivier Pescheux has really done his homework here and keeps this chypre accord alive by adding some pink pepper to the patchouli heart, which helps hide the synthetic wood accord that zips and zings about within the seams. The base has some synthetic musk with an animalic tone (probably civetone) dosed real low with evernyl backfill and some of that aforementioned wood accord which becomes the \"chypre\" of the whole thing in place of something like sandalwood or cedar. I can't tell if it's some mix of polysantal, javanol and cedral or something else because the blending is too good, but I get the sharp \"woodiness\" that slides alongside the \"mossiness\" and the \"muskiness\" of the base; these things take a nose used to older specimens to familiar territory by proxy, but not with 100% accuracy. Wear time is good for an eau de parfum, and sillage is not verbose like an 80's perfume, but this is beautiful nonetheless. \n\r\nFans of modern rose perfumes really haven't had better outside maybe an expensive bottle of Portrait of a Lady by Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle (2010) or a nice taif rose perfume from a Middle Eastern house, as most other niche perfumers seem focused on fresh \"rose water\" types like Maison Francis Kurkdjian's \u00c0 la Rose (2014) if they're not playing with oud or patchouli. With Eau Capitale, Diptyque shows us that a \"big\" rose perfume without oud is still possible in these bleak times of aromachemical dependency and marketing department creative suffocation, although perfumistas used to the taste of vintage roses will find this homage to be a bridge too far in adulteration.  I like me a nice no-holds-barred shoulderpadded Aqua Net hair tease of a rose perfume too, which is why I'll always love vintage Montana Parfum de Peau, but sometimes it can be a bit \"extra\" whereas something like this may scratch that same itch more discreetly. Oh well, I'm not going to split hairs here. This smells good. See for yourself. Thumbs up. ",

It's interesting that in every Dior store I've visited, the older versions have disappeared entirely and are no longer for sale.  Makes me long for duty-free.  Anyway, it's already been said, but Dior Homme 2020 is nothing like its predecessors.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but the result to my nose is a fragrance that will sell like gangbusters, while sacrificing what made the original Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense versions some of the greatest achievements in men's perfumery.  It's Dior's riposte to Chanel Bleu--and I'm not knocking either scent.\n\r\nSpeaking as a fan of the original Dior Homme and Intense versions with all their iris and vanilla, you don't necessarily have to be a mature man to wear them, but it helps.  This version I think will appeal to a wider age spectrum, and the addition of Iso E Super and synthetic woods may help draw the youth vote.  But where the original was Bruce Wayne in a mansion with an aristocratic perspective, the new seems more Bruce in a condo with snow or with palm trees, and a Nespresso maker he's proud of and better Internet.  In short, it smells modern and of a man who's made it or wants to show that.  Gatsby might have worn it.  The warm comfort of the original, like sitting with a glass of sherry before a wood fire in the den, is replaced by a cool gas furnace and fake flames.  That's not to say it's not good.  But the synthetic aspect shares a lot with Sauvage (although they are completely different scents).  The cashmere is really appealing to me, and with the chemicals in this composition, it lasts forever with just a couple of sprays (a word to the wise).  Dior Homme 2020, in short, smells expensive, and that will appeal to many.  Is it also like a meme of the term \"expensive?\"  Yes.  But will it snap your head back like a Porsche slammed into overdrive?  Again, yes.  Time will tell for this one.  And though I may not like the trend, I think the madding crowd will love this.\n\n",

			"content": "Dior Homme 2020 is a very clean, crisp, sour-fresh and subtly sweet, airy, citrus-woody fragrance that is undoubtedly for men. It has a modern, deft, and synthetically polished feel to it--a skillful arrangement of cutting-edge aroma-chemicals which keep it on a swift, current, and stylish plane. It is NOT markedly synthetic in the harsh, clumsy, abrasive sense of modern designers that use their chemicals in heavy-handed, disproportionate fashions. However, it uses significant amounts of Iso-E Super, ambroxan, and white musks to illustrate its effect. But unless you're overly sensitive to aroma-chemicals, this should not bother you, as it's handled in a skillful manner, with no particular chemical getting in the way or obscuring the overall experience.\n\r\n2020's bergamot is fresh and sour, approximating the smell of lemons and limes, and it opens bright and vibrant. It's the first thing to appear after spraying 2020 and it's immediately followed by woody undertones, creating a woody-citrus impression that feels light and lively. But there's more to it than just citrus and woods. Behind the bergamot, sort of in the spaces between it and the woody base, is a wonderfully subtle airy, breezy, semi-sweet smell that fills the gaps. Pink pepper has been listed as one of 2020's notes, and it's possible that it's here, mixing with some kind of white musk to create this airy sweetness that permeates through. It has a pleasant plasticky smell to it, and gives a firm, but discreet nod to the barbershop with its clean, sweet smell of tonics and powders. This is my favorite aspect of Dior Homme 2020 and perhaps its most distinct, defining aroma. It fills the spaces between the woody-citrus structure and creates a fragrance that is memorable and sophisticated, with its own unique flourish. In its base, 2020 concludes with silky smooth Iso-E, lending the fragrance transparency in a smooth, crisp, cedar wood finish. As I wear this new Dior, the fragrance appears in soft wafts, vacillating between a woody, citrus aromatic, and an airier, semi-sweet breeziness with subtle, aquatic hints. Overall, it's light, but present, and perhaps perfectly suited for a work environment or a situation where discretion is suggested. 2020 has a sophisticated, gentlemanly appeal and is perhaps a bit more mature than the average designer fragrance on the Macy's counter today. This is because it lacks the bold sweetness of many modern designers as well as the big, woody aroma chemicals that comprise their bases. It's a fragrance marked by subtlety, and smooth, proportioned and skillful blending. As a casual scent it will work well to convey an image of cleanliness, while dressed up it will add quiet elegance to one's overall image. In that sense, 2020 is versatile and the kind of fragrance that should see plenty of use. \n\r\nOne area in which I can understand people complaining about this is performance. While I personally enjoy the way 2020 performs, as I'm more in need of a discreet fragrance at this point than a loud one, if you're someone who likes your fragrances strong, with big projection and over 8 hours of longevity, you may be disappointed by this. While it has good sillage, Dior Homme 2020 doesn't project much beyond two feet at its absolute strongest, and lasts about 6 hours total. I say that with some reservation however, as aroma-chemicals like Iso-E Super can be very sneaky, coming and going in waves for a very long time while on the skin (or fabric). That's why I recommend a little caution before going all spray-crazy with this one--those aroma chemicals will get you if you're not careful. Still, 2020 does seem to be a bit not the quieter side, and not as long lasting as some of Dior's other fragrances. Personally, I don't mind this. \n\r\nFinal rating for this new release by Dior: A solid 8/10 with room for half a point more once I start wearing this and become more accustomed to it and hearing some feedback. Conversely, it could also lose half a point if its discreet performance proves 'too' discreet over time. Recommended as a blind buy if you want a palate-cleansing workhorse for the office or a mature, modern fragrance with quiet sophistication. Otherwise, sample it and see how it works out for you. And finally, Don't be scared off by all the negative press--this one's better than they'd have you believe.\n\r\nSIDE NOTE: For the record, I 100% prefer the original over this. The original is an absolute masterpiece. 2020 is simply a pleasant experience which has its firm purpose and place in my wardrobe. If the intent behind creating 2020 was to completely replace the original, entirely halting its production, I'd understand the ire. And maybe that will happen at some point (I seriously hope not). But until then we simply have more options, so this one should be able to be enjoyed on its own without the stigma of being the demise of the classic we love. Hopefully Dior is sincere about keeping the OG in production with the name \"Original\" on the bottle. But the cynic in me can't help but feel that the writing's already on the wall.",

			"content": "Rumours had persisted for the better part of 2019 that a new version of Dior Homme (2005) was coming, especially in light of Dior house perfumer Fran\u00e7ois Demachy having reformulated Olivier Polge\u2019s original 2005 composition in 2011 after taking over, as if to put his own stamp. People were unhappy then with the change from iconic sliver stem to black in the bottle, but the scent was more or less recognizable as it was before. After that, Demachy began messing with flankers, inventing and reinventing them several times through multiple iterations, dialing back the signature iris accord just a little more each time until it was completely absent from the last version of Dior Homme Cologne (2013). However, Demachy did something of a fake-out and tricked everyone thinking he hated iris by releasing Dior Homme Eau (2014) the following year, which probably has the most-bitter representation of the note in the whole line, only to walk back by releasing the latest version of DIor Homme Sport (2017) that once again removed it almost completely (but not entirely like in Dior Homme Cologne). I know what you might be thinking: why all this fuss over iris and cacao? Maybe it\u2019s the fact that iris is a signature note of Olivier Polge, as he was to feature it again in Valentino Uomo (2017) before replacing his father at Chanel as house perfumer, or maybe Fran\u00e7ois Demachy just really wants to rebuild the Dior Homme portfolio to his own standard, but realistically the answer is something far less dramatic . Dior Homme just doesn\u2019t sell well enough for the kind of numbers designers want to pull from their mainstream releases these days and Dior asked him to re-orchestrate it into an entirely new scent. Iris is something of a niche flavor in men\u2019s perfume because it is so indelibly associated with women\u2019s cosmetics thanks to Guerlain lipstick scented with Shalimar (1925) and Coty\u2019s Air-Spun face powder, itself scented with Coty L\u2019Orignan (1905) before that. Some guys could just never get over that makeup-like ionone note no matter how you dress it up, and after the initial flash of gourmand genius that was Dior Homme in 2005, it clung to survival only so long based on a hardcore minority fanbase. Keep in mind I say this with love as a fan myself.\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say Dior Homme [New] (2020) should instantly be abhorred and shunned as a pretender to the throne for replacing a sacred and beloved fragrance among hardcore Dior fans, and Dior itself is smart enough to redub the outgoing formula as \u201cOriginale\u201d like they did with the first version of Miss Dior (1947), but this move also means more-limited production and likely a higher pricetag because of it. For those willing to wade into new designer waters, this 2020 iteration of Dior Homme is an intensely woody affair, overdosing sour musks and woods in the same way Dior Sauvage (2015) overdosed ambroxan and norlimbanol to create its own buzzy scratchy \u201cdesert-like\u201d warmth. The opening of Dior Homme [New] is full of bergamot, pink pepper, and elemi. This sour blast is boosted with a heart of cashmeran, a synthetic wood saddled with the natural wood of atlas cedar and dry patchouli to create a green aromatic core that the sourness floats on. The base is a bit of musk and vetiver, with a touch of cypriol and a lot of Iso E Super in similar fashion to Terre d\u2019Herm\u00e8s (2008), of which I can see this draws some inspiration. Is this sexy as the new ad copy claims? Well not really, and I can tell you that the sourness of the elemi and cypriol contrasted with the herbal woody nature of this scent is going to be somewhat divisive and not mass-appealling like Sauvage, but also more \u201cclassically masculine\u201d like a citrus chypre for men from the mid-20th century. Granted, there\u2019s no oakmoss or sandalwood to give this the gravitas and naturalism vintage guys would expect from an accord like this, but Demachy tries to capture the same mood with modern McMolecules. Dior Homme [New] therefore is ultimately safer, and better for the office or generalist use than either previous iteration of Dior Homme before it, which translates to higher sales in the accountant-lead world of post-2000\u2019s profit-centric designer perfume. Wear time is about 8 hours on average, with moderate performance all around, leaving a nice tart trail that will follow you throughout the day. Suggested use is fall through early spring for business casual environments or evenings.\n\r\nWill fans of the original Dior Homme like this new version? Most likely not, and many of them are already screeching like incensed banshees at the notion of not getting their iris fix from their beloved favorite Dior, but some of the most discerning (also read: stuck up) Dior Homme fans clocked out years ago when the stem changed from silver to black and won\u2019t wear anything but original vintage Dior Homme anyway, so you can\u2019t exactly take their opinion to the bank. Personally, I like this scent well enough, but being a connoisseur of cheap-ish barbershop and drugstore masculines anyway, I\u2019ve already smelled this sort of \u201csour citrus over herbs, musk and woods\u201d combination before, as budget hearthrobs like Avon and Revlon have been doing it for decades before Demachy decided to make the Dior version of this style. You can go all the way back to Moustache by Rochas (1949) if you really want to smell the origin of the species, and get real whiffs of bergamot, sandalwood, oakmoss, and civet musk while you\u2019re at it. Likewise, Avon did this style as recently as Avon Paradigm (2002), just with a leather twist and more herbs. Many people are already sharpening the edges of their pitchforks and lighting the bonfires without having even smelled this new Dior Homme, gearing up to tear down Castle Dior and pull Demachy from his bed for a proper scarlet lettering, but if the original iteration of Dior Homme remains available even if in limited distrubution, it should be enough for folks wishing to sit this one out. Otherwise, Valentino Uomo is also availabe if you don\u2019t mind a splash of Nutella in your ionone-based iris, and for those undaunted by gender boundaries, Guerlain Shalimar will likely be available until the end of days. Taken on its own, Dior Homme [New] is a novel \u201cn\u00fc-chypre\u201d sort of deal for men, and although I think it would have been better served by a new name, I can set aside politics and enjoy it, just not in the company of other fragrance enthusiasts for fear of my life.

The company, Bombi, made only a handful of scents, among them Strange Venture (1946) and Entre Nous (1948).\n\r\nThe description is accurate in every degree. This is an old-fashioned oriental floral. The experience is complex, despite its few notes. The undisclosed \u201ccitrus\u201d, bergamot and orange blossom top is fresh and sweet. It\u2019s middle note of gardenia, being an oil created in the lab since the flower\u2019s oil has no scent, is most probably a mix of jasmine and tuberose, which provides unctuous depth. There is ylang here as well to provide a fruity-floral note. There are undisclosed \u201cspices\u201d as well.  Clove is certainly present and perhaps cinnamon as well, adding to the sweetness. The solid base of musk, sandalwood, amber, patchouli and vanilla rounds out the creation.\n\r\nThis is a perfume for winter months. In summer it would strike me as being potentially cloying. It is unisex by today\u2019s standards. There is a camphor note which is not attributable to the note tree, but which swirls through the concoction. I find this note in a modern scent, Mousse Illuminee, and the only notes there that might be responsible are artemisia and laurel, with which I am not familiar.  I blind bought this from a private internet seller and although it took a while to get used to, I now love and wear it sparingly.\n\r\nStill available on the internet and worth a try for those into the genre of oriental florals.\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s coffee-dominant but with a very healthy helping of cardamom.\n\r\nThe opening for me has an almost super-spicy, licorice-like sharpness to it, but this quickly fades away and gives way to the coffee, first and foremost, and the cardamom, as a supporting piece, with some of the creamy, sweetening elements in the background.  De Toma a Zouma has an excellent balance in the dry down to the point that I can enjoy the coffee and cardamom clearly but neither is overwhelming and the sweetness is still detectable, a really harmonious mix.  It\u2019s just vanilla and benzoin; the accents of tonka and nutmeg are impressive in restraining the overall blend from leaning too creamy. \n\r\nKerosene Follow might be my very favorite coffee-dominant fragrance, and it\u2019s largely what I recommend to fans of coffee in fragrance (like me), because the coffee aspect of it is big and dark, though Follow similarly incorporates a lot of amber and vanilla to sweeten the pot.  So Follow incorporates both extremes in balance.  By contrast, De Toma a Zouma doesn\u2019t seem to be extreme in any sense, but has a restrained balance that makes it a bit subtler, albeit still rich and fairly dense.\n\r\nAdditionally, I\u2019d be remiss not to note that while I\u2019m sure there are scores of coffee/cardamom fragrances, some no doubt inspired by beverages of that ilk, perhaps more popular elsewhere in the rest of the world than the US, De Toma a Zouma does remind me of one in particular that I smelled and purchased relatively recently, Caf\u00e9 Noir by DSH Perfumes.  There are some differences, though, but both are enjoyable, coffee/cardamom-dominant fragrances that are both sweet and spicy, so I\u2019d certainly recommend looking into the other if you\u2019ve tried one or generally like the sound of one. \n\r\nDe Toma a Zouma may not be a cup of coffee that I\u2019d drink, but I enjoy it is both a near wholly-gourmand and environmental experience.  I enjoy its smell in the way that I enjoy the smell of coffee, even if it\u2019s not specifically a cup of coffee that I\u2019d drink.  It does not project loudly beyond a couple of hours but has a strong aroma near the skin that has not faded at all, which is generally what I\u2019m looking for, anyway.\n\r\nIn EDP concentration, De Toma a Zouma is priced at $130 for 50ml bottle and is surely now on my list to buy.  The ingredients feel high-quality and I\u2019m looking forward to having this in my collection someday.  It\u2019s definitely among the best coffee scents I\u2019ve ever tried and is a neat blend overall.  I look forward to trying the rest of my sample pack, too.\n\r\n8 out of 10\n",

			"content": "My third from the new Motif Olfactif is Mon Oasis, a woody, fresh, green blend of lavender, vetiver, oakmoss, hay, tobacco, musk, cedar, and sandalwood.  I suppose it\u2019s the yuzu note, additionally (perhaps the pear, too), that gives Mon Oasis such a lift but the heart of it mainly seems to be a green/woody/semi-earthy blend.\n\r\nIt\u2019s definitely idiosyncratic, as there\u2019s a \u201cgreen vetiver\u201d vibe that\u2019s unfamiliar, as most of the fresher vetiver fragrances I\u2019m familiar with (Guerlain Vetiver, Roja Vetiver Extrait, even Gallivant Berlin) are fresh because of citrus notes, which are completely absent from Mon Oasis.  So while Mon Oasis is fresh, it\u2019s not a freshie.  I estimate that the hay creates an interesting base, too, something divergent from the more familiar vetiver and tobacco notes; something animalic, spicy, earthy.\n\r\nLike the other fragrances from the line I\u2019ve tried, Mon Oasis is fairly dense, too.  There\u2019s not an airiness to it, and I generally like denser fragrances, myself\u2014less juice required, and longer-lasting.  This seems to be perform well, to that point.  \n\r\nMon Oasis is concentrated at 24%, EDP, and is priced at $130 for 50ml, like the other EDP offerings in the line.  As far as I know, the line is only sold on the house website for the time being.\n\r\nRegardless of taste / scent profile, Mon Oasis seems like it has the quality that I\u2019ve now come to expect from the line after sampling a couple of its offerings over the past week.  In the case of Mon Oasis in particular, I enjoy its quirkiness and it ranks high as far as uniqueness because the yuzu/pear, though I\u2019m not certain it\u2019s something I would reach for often.  It could definitely be a more unique alternative to other vetiver fragrances, though, for example.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

I sometimes overuse the phrase, \u201cclassic meets modern,\u201d but from the initial spray, that\u2019s the vibe I get from Murmure Chypre, a classic unisex chypre\u2014maybe ever so slightly feminine, with its hefty use of iris/orris, alongside jasmine, musk, patchouli, leather, tobacco, oakmoss, and even civet, per the note listing\u2014yet somehow modernized.\n\r\nAs is often the case, the very presence of orris/iris makes them stand out to me a lot.  They are, especially, in this case, the powdery sharp instruments that sing above the rest of the orchestra and lead the group.   The rest of the mix mainly provides an earthy, slightly animalic, slightly dirty backdrop.  I\u2019d say I get a bit more patchouli and the musk than the rest; I don\u2019t particularly detect much leather, tobacco, or oakmoss, though oakmoss, especially, could just be lurking the background.  \n\r\nMurmure Chypre is dense, rich, and frankly somewhat opulent, and feels more apropos for cold weather than warm weather.  At extrait concentration, Murmure Chypre is priced at $150 for 50ml, comparable to the rest of the line, and is sold only through the house website, to my knowledge.  I\u2019d certainly recommend ordering a sample set to try the original five.\n\r\n7 out of 10\n",

It has a certain honeyed vibe that is inviting, but it also has some bite to it, as well, though I can\u2019t place it, apart from perhaps the concentration of resins\u2014the galbanum, in particular, if I had to guess. It\u2019s plenty fruity, a hard-to-define mix, but the fruits and resins are most of the story. It\u2019s not uncannily sweet, either. The other elements (several resins, woods, and vetiver) keep the fruits in check, and it feels reasonably balanced, in that respect.\n\r\nIts concentration is EDP and its pricing is comparable to the rest of the line, at $130 for 50ml. Like the rest of the line, Nectar Boise is fairly rich and dense and a good performer. The ingredients feel high-quality / somewhat natural, and it\u2019s a nice blend, overall.\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to have tried out the initial five offerings from this house and look forward to continue to try the new releases that follow.\n\r\n7 out of 10",

			"content": "Voile D\u2019encens is my second try from Motif Olfactif, the house launched by Oswald Pare / Mr. Oz in late 2019, my second try from my sample pack after De Toma a Zouma.  Voile D\u2019encens is an interesting exploration of incense, a mix of frankincense, olibanum, and elemi, primarily, with sharp and fruity touches.  Pear, rhubarb, rose, and vetiver accent the incense-dominant.  The resins lean sharper and brighter than they do smokier but there are smoky touches as well.   It\u2019s slightly sweet, slightly tart, but not especially either, at least not more than it is resinous.\n\r\nI enjoy that the pear and especially the rhubarb aren\u2019t a momentary burst in the opening, as plants sometimes are, but last into the dry down and remain a part of the mix throughout.  I generally do not enjoy pear when used significantly but in concert with the rhubarb, it really works well as a complement to the incense. \n\r\nVoile D\u2019encens is fun and quirky yet elegantly composed, clearly with care, and it gives me something different, particularly in the world of incense, from what I\u2019m accustomed to smelling.  Definitely a recommended try, as I suspect will be the case with much of the line, as I loved De Toma a Zouma.\n\r\nVoile D\u2019encens is a 28% extrait concentration at $140 for 50ml, so actually not much more than the $130 EDP De Toma a Zouma.  It performs well, quite dense, and the ingredients feel rich.\n\r\nI quite like this one\u2014I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d wear it a lot personally, but it\u2019s a curiosity and has some complexity and intrigue, more inventive that the majority of new fragrances that I come across.

The scents produced number thirty and they first appeared in 1919, the last in 1948.\n\r\nUn Soir A Venise would seem to be one of their last scents, debuting in 1948. It is a wonderfully fresh, sweet floral, slightly green, and very suited to a youthful wearer. The rare use of lilac in parfumerie here provides a solid and central green note, which is supported by the green of muguet and galbanum. Against these are the heady sweetness of hyacinth, orange flower, and jasmine. Rose, musk, oak moss and sandalwood provide solid, but unintrusive, support.\n\r\nI would have sworn that honeysuckle and sweet pea were in this mix somewhere, as it does give that impression of old-fashioned floral arrangements. Perhaps they are lurking behind the note tree.\n\r\nI am not usually a fan of sweet florals, finding them for the most part cloying. Not so this scent. It is most uplifting and joyful. As fresh and heady as a summer garden in the heat of mid-day.\n\r\nIt has great projection and longevity, so a little bit goes a long way. A delightful vintage find!\n\n",

			"content": "Tom Ford Rose Prick (2020) is another ostentaciously-named limited edition private blend that banks on the deep pockets and fervent loyalty of  superfans into the brand image of the Tom Ford label. Like other exclusives from this line, the composition itself is fairly gimmicky and linear, being a straightforward conceptualization a la Fucking Fabulous (2017), Lost Cherry (2018), and Lavender Extr\u00eame (2019) before it. Unlike the previous entries in this super-expensive flash-in-the-pan range, there is a bit more going on with Rose Prick beyond the obvious, but this is through and through a rose fragrance. If you can get past the fleshy pink bottle and the lewd name, you'll be presented with a candied sort of rose, heavy on tonka bean and fractured patchouli in the base, coming across like a lighter \"macaroon flavoring\" take on Tom Ford Noir de Noir (2007). This part I like about the scent, but the rest I really don't, even if I can't bring myself to exactly dislike Rose Prick either. \n\r\nThe opening of Rose Prick is a jammy Turkish rose blended with the more-common Bulgarian rose and a bit of that powdery rose de mai which sometimes finds its way into soaps, cremes, or lighter feminine-market rose products. This blend works to establish that candied confectionary sort of rose I mentioned earlier, and sits on top of the mostly pink pepper heart. The pink pepper and Sichuan pepper add body and heft to what would otherwise be a pretty transparent accord, and the synthetic patchouli/tonka base gives that rounded gourmand oriental-ish heft, but it's never woody or mossy like a chypre. Rose Prick isn't particularly fresh either even if it isn't the usual dark oriental rose, so you're left with a middling sweet \"rose flavoring\" on your skin, which probably has naughty intentions behind it. This lasts over 10 hours even though it isn't a screamer in the projection department, so Rose Prick is definitely more of an intimate sort of affair meant for weekends or long nights under romantic duress. \n\r\nThis isn't really my favorite interpretation of rose and for the price is utterly ridiculous, as there are many higher-quality rose and patch combos for much less money or expensive truly niche rose perfumes far more worth your coin than something that takes the rose/patch tandem and gives it the Willy Wonka treatment. Collectors of these aren't likely to give their bottles regular use because that isn't the point, so like most novelty fragrances from this lineup, it will be bought then squirrelled away for investment and flipping, or the yearly indulgence. Of course, with enough traction this scent could become the next Fucking Fabulous and be re-released in larger number again the following year (then indefinitely), but that hasn't happened so far with the others so don't hold your breath. Rose Prick is just another example of liquid brand hype sold at nosebleed prices per milliliter, but a mildly amusing adulteration of the core accord which made Noir de Noir so good. Try it for yourself but don't get pricked in the process. Neutral. ",

It's a simple, efficient blend, one designed not to attest to the cleverness of the perfumer but the complexity of the notes, which compliment each other well. The ingredient quality is seemingly fairly high insofar as each note feels three-dimensional, and Saffron Tobacco makes a pronounced evolution from that dry, spicy, smoky saffron opening to a dirty chocolate-patch drydown (for those who fear the word \"chocolate,\" whatever is going on here is much too earthy to qualify as a gourmand.\n\r\nIt's an EDT, and any higher concentration would be too much; this is fairly persistent, with enough airiness in the structure to let the notes flirt with one another without congealing together.",

The oakmoss and tobacco slightly recede as the perfume progresses to its early heart, leaving the patchouli as the star, with the still significant oakmoss presence coupling with an emerging ashy coniferous green-woody accord similar to the one found in vintage Polo as co-stars through the heart with warm spices featuring nutmeg in support. During the late dry-down, the ashy coniferous accord vacates and the patchouli recedes, leaving the oakmoss and warm spices as co-stars through the finish, with remnants of the patchouli now in support. Projection is excellent, as is longevity at 12 hours on skin.\n\r\nLucifer checks all the right boxes for me. It combines elements of vintage Captain Molyneux, vintage original Polo, Balenciaga pour Homme and Havana.

I have no idea why this offering didn\u2019t sell, but had I sniffed it last century when it was released, I would have bought it without hesitation.

Sorry to be bossy, but I\u2019m really going to have to insist you disregard any reviews you see for Thichila that make it out to be tremendously complex, floral, incensey, old school, or even chypre-ish \u2013 it\u2019s really none of those things. Because Thichila is one of those perfumes that happens to be composed in an Eastern style and uses complex-smelling, exotic naturals, many people \u2013 mostly Westerners \u2013 may mistake its complexity for a matter of construction. As a matter of fact, Thichila is simply one big bridge built between two massively complex materials \u2013 a natural Thai oud oil and a big, rustic myrrh. These two monoliths happen, in this case, to share a peculiarly rubbery-rooty-oily-anisic character that makes it difficult to tell where one ends and the other takes over.

It reminds me very much of one of FeelOud\u2019s more unusual-smelling oud oils, whose name I can\u2019t recall right now, but which smelled like the air that escapes from plastic lunchboxes that you\u2019re opening for the first time in three months when the new term is starting.\n\r\nAt some point, the sweet, plasticky rubber tube of oud rolls into the scent of myrrh \u2013 gloomy and rubbery, but also sweet and crunchy, like giant golden sugar crystals dipped in anise and spread in a hard, glittery paste across your skin. I think Thichila is, on balance, a great perfume, but fair warning \u2013 you have to love this particular style of oud oil and this particular sort of myrrh for it to be a success for you.

The mold and the dustiness, the \u2018aged\u2019 browny tint of the earth smell, its overall murk and gloom \u2013 this reminds me of the \u2018newly-opened tomb\u2019 dead air that billows out of Onda parfum (Vero Profumo) and Djedi (Guerlain).\n\r\nBut here and there, there is the juicy rudeness of new plant life poking its way through, the air crackling with ozone. So yes, though the hummus-rich, brown-green earthiness is all-encompassing at first, soon you notice that it is pierced here and there with the minty vase water of oakmoss.\n\r\nOn balance, however, this is not a particularly fresh or herbal example of a foug\u00e8re. Pandan leaf, or screwpine, is mentioned in the notes list, so perhaps the gentle sweetness of those screwpine ittar they use to flavor syrups, tobacco, and cosmetics in India is what is relieving Mohragot of that tiresomely \u2018Brut\u2019-like, aftershavey bitterness that usually makes foug\u00e8res such a bore to wear (as a woman). The pandan leaf note gives Mohragot an interestingly milky, nutty tonality, yet it is not as piercingly sweet or as fruity as an actual screwpine ittar. I find Mohragot one of the more interesting perfumes in the Prissana line, because it takes a while to pick apart, and even after three or four wears, parts of it remain impenetrable to me. I do appreciate that the ubiquitous 21st century finish of dopey tonka bean has been swapped out for a softly musky tobacco accord that smells like an idealized vision of an autumn walk. Unfortunately, Mohragot disappears from my skin within three hours. Now, I\u2019m no longevity bore, but for $160 for 30mls, that\u2019s just taking the piss. ",

In keeping with its Japanese inspiration, it smells quite like a Di Ser perfume in that its tingly, orangey citrus notes (neroli in this case) tinged with the wintergreen finger snap of camphor and silvery, refined hinoki wood. In other words, neroli filtered through a Japanese sensibility rather than through the regular ole channel of an Amalfi citrus grove. It is fresh and sharp, and quite medicinal, like the cool, steamy air in a Japanese onsen on Hokkaido island, where you are getting rubbed down by a masseur with unpronounceable Japanese herbs, damp sea mosses, and yuzu-style citruses that probably only exist within 2 miles of the onsen and nowhere else.

A fantastically fresh and sour take on the classic French eau de cologne, it is something like Eau Sauvage or \u00d4 de Lanc\u00f4me flushed with the mouth-stripping aroma of lemongrass \u2013 half lemon, half rooty grass \u2013 and freshly-squeezed limes. These tart, aromatic topnotes are all under-pinned with a gorgeously sweet and dusty galangal note that stands in for musk and serves an a pillowy extension cord for the citruses well into the drydown. Although Tom Yum doesn\u2019t smell as authentically hot, sour, or herbaceous as a bowl of Tom Yum itself, and is therefore not nearly as exotic as the notes list wants you to believe, it is still the rare \u2018update\u2019 to the eau de cologne model that actually works (and lasts).\n\r\nTom Yum is just sour enough in the topnotes to refresh, herbaceous and soapy enough in the midsection to offer that essential coolness, and sweetly spicy enough in the tailbone to avoid that throat-catching sourness of laundry musk that tires my palate in most modern takes. For me, Tom Yum competes head-to-head with the basil leaf-inflected blast of air conditioning that is the bottle of Paris-Deauville (Chanel) I keep in the door of my fridge as a substitute for, you know, actual air conditioning. If you have the money to spend on an eau de cologne-style perfume and want it to last a fair amount of time without having to choke on nasty woody ambers or oceans of white musk, then I highly recommend Tom Yum.

But the inspiration is here, and it is very well done! Take a fresh cologne base, and add lemongrass, kaffir lime and galangal root which are main ingredients in the soup, and you have a fantastic fresh fragrance with an Asian dna that works well in the heat. Refreshing and unique and highly recommended.\n\r\nUnisex and quite long lasting.",

			"content": "Tom Yum skips any top notes to speak of, instead moving directly to its highly aromatic heart comprised of a starring herbal-citrus combination of kaffir lime leaf, lemon-like lemongrass and natural smelling, sharp lemon and lime with significant gingery galangal spice support and hints of creamy coconut milk.  The composition stays highly linear through its development, with the kaffir lime leaf and lemongrass driven aromatics remaining through most of the composition's lifespan, very gradually giving way to the slightly nutty chalood bark finish.  Projection is below average to average, with below average longevity of 4-6 hours on skin.\n\r\nTom Yum (the perfume) may not really be a gourmand, but the name based on the highly aromatic Thai Hot and Sour soup dish does do a fabulous mouth watering job of making the wearer crave the soup, while being equally successful as a fine, natural smelling Eau de Cologne style composition that is completely wearable and heavenly.  It is really hard to describe one of the two key drivers of the composition, kaffir lime leaf, but anyone familiar with Thai food (and certainly Tom Yum) will know what to expect and will find it very believable smelling here.  The lemongrass is the other key driver, and when combined with the kaffir lime, the two just seem made for each other.  While not listed in the perfume notes, another component of Tom Yum soup, coconut milk, makes a subtle appearance to further strengthen the believably of the \"dish.\"  Alas, as fine as the composition smells, its 100% natural ingredient strength from a believability perspective is its performance downfall.  If I had one wish, it would be that the perfumer would have added just a bit of synthetics to the mix to aid performance.  As is, the composition is fantastic smelling, just short-lived.  The bottom line is the $140 per 30ml bottle Tom Yum is an \"excellent\" 4 stars out of 5 rated composition that is as mouth watering to wear, as is its Thai soup namesake to consume, earning it a strong recommendation to lovers of the soup, or just superb smelling aromatic Eau de Cologne style compositions in general.      \n\n",

			"content": "Maruyama smells to me like a richly vegetal cis-jasmone or immortelle scent, i.e., floral notes with clear overtones of burnt hay, maple sugar, or strange exotic herbs like lovage that smell half like a white flower, half like celery. It reminded me at first of Comme des Garcons\u2019 Sequoia and then of Cardamom Rose Sugar by Solstice Scents. There\u2019s always a point at which this sort of thing smells pleasantly like a glazed maple-cider doughnut to me, and then slightly but ever so insistently of curry and caramelized brown sugar mashed together, at which point I don\u2019t really want to smell it at all. If you don\u2019t hit that plateau quite so quickly as I do, then I highly recommend Maruyama as an exotic Eastern take on the classically French \u2018Sables\u2019 (Annick Goutal) territory.",

			"content": "I\u2019m confused by just how much I enjoy the gourmand perfumes in the Strangers Parfumerie line-up.  Gourmand perfumes are not generally my thing. The designer ones are gloppy glucose bombs with zero distinguishing features, the niche ones use higher quality or more interesting sugar-choco-frooty aromachemicals but unfortunately tend to arrive at much the same place as the designer ones (and cost about $200 more), and the indies, well, in their effort to be all weird and ironic and indie about it, push the gourmand notes into ever-increasingly grotesque forms just for the sake of it (with few of them very wearable in the long run).\n\r\nSo Fetch, for example, has a protein bar accord and is based on a phrase from Mean Girls, so you\u2019ll forgive me if I say I was ready to automatically class this with the third category. But I WAS WRONG. This stuff is just delightful. It has sass. It opens up on a huge whoosh of cherry-flavored fizz, as if someone dropped a whole packet of Love Hearts into a 2 liter plastic bottle of 7-Up and shook it all up until it exploded like a trailer park Prosecco.\n\r\nSo Fetch makes me feel young. It makes me imagine what Bendelirious by \u00c9tat Libre d\u2019Orange might smell like if cross-pollinated with the rubbery tennis balls of The Soft Lawn (Imaginary Authors). There are, at points, beguiling little whiffs of rubber tires, fuel exhaust, and lemon-scented sherbet powder. In the drydown, notes of pink lemonade, strawberry erasers, and marshmallow fluff float into the picture \u2013 basically the same soft, billowy lokhoum fun of Douleur! by Bogue, minus the enamel-stripping rose oxide. Really, really good stuff.",

			"content": "Pinaud \u2013 Flor Di Manzano (1890/1932)\n\r\nPinaud is known mainly for light floral powdery lotions for men, ranging from their popular Clubman range through lime and orange secs as well as eaus de quinine and Portugal.\n\r\nI had not known that they had a solid 19th century popularity, creating women\u2019s scents (1824-1890) with dozens listed on Perfume Intelligence. I came across this little gem as a gift from a friend.  A beautiful half ounce parfum, entitled Flor di Manzano, had me guessing for a while as to exactly what I was experiencing. Research told me that \u201cManzano\u201d referred to the apple (fruit, tree, blossom) and that finally allowed me to visualize the aroma. This is the sweet, slightly pungent, scent one experiences upon cutting into a ripe, fresh apple and inhaling the aroma.\n\r\nPatchouli, musk, strong dark citrus notes at first. Softly subtle as it calms down. Quite unisex and sensual. Apple blossom was a popular solifore during the 19th century with nearly sixty listed in Perfume Intelligence. It is a scent practically forgotten today and as such is a unique olfactory experience.\n\r\nManzano is something to be sought out for those who desire a brand new scent experience.\n\n",

			"content": "No. 59 opens with a nose tingling, fresh nutmeg and cardamom tandem with hints of slightly sweet vanilla enhanced tobacco before transitioning to its heart.  As the composition reaches its early heart the slightly sweet vanilla enhanced natural smelling tobacco takes the fore, with smooth frankincense melding with the nutmeg and cardamom warm spice remaining, adding just the slightest hint of subtle rose floral support.  During the late dry-down, the tobacco significantly recedes though never completely vacates, revealing an amber-like labdanum that takes the fore, joining the tobacco, frankincense and warm spice remnants through the finish. Projection is excellent, as is longevity at around 12 hours on skin.\n\r\nNo.59 is the kind of composition that is not going to knock your socks off with innovation, but rather wins you over with its warm, comfortable familiarity, impressing with some very natural smelling ingredients that are easy to relate to and conjure up special old memories.  More specifically, No.59 is a tobacco perfume at its core.  The tobacco note used smells very convincing and wholly enticing, while the warm nutmeg prominent spice and deep, smooth supporting incense just flesh out the tobacco further.  There is an added sweetness that made me think of pipe tobacco when I wore the composition the first time, but on further wearings I believe actually the smell is closer to fine cigar tobacco leaf, but with a mild natural smelling sweetener like vanilla added to give an ultimate impression somewhere in between the two. The end result of warm spiced, slightly sweet tobacco leaf underpinned by incense is as sublime as it is relatively minimalist. If there is a weakness to No. 59 it would have to be in the amber spiced vanilla-like late dry-down.  There is nothing wrong with it, but after the amazing heart it comes off as a bit of a let-down in comparison.  All-in-all, a fine effort from perfumer Matt Meleg.  The bottom line is the approximately $120 USD per 50ml bottle No.59 may not wow with innovation, but instead impresses with sophistication and high ingredient quality, earning it an \"excellent\" 4 stars out of 5 rating and a solid recommendation to those seeking a classically structured warm spiced tobacco and incense perfume. \n\n",

			"content": "I wasn't exactly kind to the original Maison Francis Kurkdjian \u00c0 la rose (2014) but I also wasn't exactly unfair either. It was a clean, \"girly rose\" sort of drugstore number made a bit more modern by having an aromachemical base rather than the oakmoss chypre base that might have been used in years past, but was still the sort of thing Bath & Body Works or Elizabeth Arden cranks out with perhaps a little less finesse than MFK. The dealbreaker to the original \u00c0 la rose was what you got for the price you paid, and although Francis Kurkdjian is a consummate genius that excels at whatever concept he approaches, the underpinning concept of \u00c0 la rose was its failing since the ultimate price tag for MFK's take on a drugstore scent is easily five to ten times the average segment competitor. I'm all about \"what the market abides\" in the luxury world (because it is luxury after all), but with MFK, you usually get something a little more unique, polished, and avant-gard for your luxury dollars, so having \"just a rose\" perfume sounds a bit like catalog padding to my ears. Apparently I'm in the minority because this simple rose perfume sold so well that MFK was incentivized to make a flanker in L'eau \u00c0 la rose (2019), a fruity-floral fragrance based on the core of the original but decidedly fresher, younger, and more casual for hotter weather. With L'eau \u00c0 la rose, Maison Francis Kurkdjian really goes after those spoiled brat one-percenter trust fund teenage daughter dollars, or at least parent company Est\u00e9e Lauder does and Mr. Kurkdjian is just required to satisfy a brief as per whatever contract he signed when he sold his business to them.\n\r\nThe opening of L'eau \u00c0 la rose is much brighter, fresher, and more tangy than the original, and this has mostly to do with the addition of Lychee to the mix of lemon and bergamot, with the removal of orange. Peony replaces violet in the heart of L'eau \u00c0 la rose compared to the original, and this makes for less sharpness to the rose blend of Turkish and Centifolia. The fruity zip of the lychee sticks around during the full wear, so perhaps you might call it a heart note too, as the whole of this scent becomes \"one accord\" unlike with the original \u00c0 la rose. There isn't much going on in the base besides some light aromachemical wood-ish Iso E Super kind of deal over a light musk note, making the final skin feel come across like an overpriced Calgon spray to my nose, removed from the harsh chemical alcohol-heavy sharpness that something $5 and served up in a plastic bottle might have. That's the only real redeeming value of L'eau \u00c0 la rose, being a well-refined, blended, and consistent version of a fruity floral rose body mist you might otherwise buy at Wal-Mart or CVS. Wear time is very short at about 4 hours and the projection here burns off pretty quick within the first 30 minutes so once again, this compares more to a drug store product than a proper perfume. On the up side, this is a \"wear anywhere\" kind of youthful rose refresher perfect for summer, casual gatherings, and is a little more unisex in tone than the original because of the decreased \"rose soliflore\" factor thanks to the lychee. If you're the type to seek out niche solutions to common fragrance needs, and have no shortage of cash, you may find this worthwhile.\n\r\nThe big problem with L'eau \u00c0 la rose is it doubles down on the superfluous nature of the original, being a gourmet take on a common, almost commodity-like accord, shifting from drugstore rose perfume to even cheaper fruity-fresh drugstore body mist. I get that niche perfumers do this for common male styles too, and with few exceptions, I usually knock down luxury takes on ubiquitous aquatic, ambrox, or other \"gym bag\" men's staples as well, because it's insulting to ask so much money for what is basically a redress on a staple (or at least as much \"staple\" as any perfume can be). Maybe I would be kinder if this lasted much longer like all the luxury \"eau de cologne\" takes I've smelled, but as it stands L'eau \u00c0 la rose barely can get out of its own way. Francis Kurkdjian again does wonders here, and this is the smoothest version of this scent profile I've ever witnessed, but is it $300 smooth? The jury is out on that one. When you also take into account that this launched on the eve of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, meaning all that luxury spending suddenly goes poof as unemployment swells with common people on lockdown and the rich shutting their coinpurses, the whole thing seems even more gauche. Granted, some of the greatest perfumes in history were released during The Spanish Flu, The Great Depression and World War II, but Maison Francis Kurkdjian L'eau \u00c0 la rose is certainly no Guerlain Mitsouko (1919), Jean Patou Joy (1930) or Royal Bain/Champagne de Caron (1941). Your mileage may vary but for me this one is just about pointless. Thumbs down.",
